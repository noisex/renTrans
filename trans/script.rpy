My name is [povname]!
Please wait until you're old enough to play this game.
You are 23 years old.
You're working at a consulting firm.
Emily Rothman is your girlfriend.
She's also 23 years old and works at the same company as you.
You've known each other since high school.
At the end of your senior year, she finally agreed to date you.
After graduating from college, you and Emily've been working for this company.
Your colleagues include Alex Johnson and Suzie Lee.
Alex is your childhood friend.
He's 23 years old, too.
And he's also Emily's friend from high school.
You and Alex were once love rivals.
But you won.
2 weeks ago, Alex started to date Suzie.
Suzie is the newest member of the company.
She's just finished college and works as your assistant.
Suzie is an attractive 21-year-old Asian girl.
Your boss, Rhys Park, assigned you and Suzie to go on a business trip.
But he wanted Suzie to be prepared for the future.
So she'll have to deal with the customer this time.
There are many routes and many endings in The Engagement.
And you, as the main character, will write the story with your decisions.
Now, let's begin your journey.
The flight was delayed last night so you haven't rested at all and only went to sleep so late, around 10AM.
It's 6PM now and you've just woken up.
Suddenly your phone starts ringing.
Hi, [povname]. How are you?
I'm fine. Just got up. Miss you so much.
How was your trip?
It's fine. Do you have plans for tonight?
Not yet, [povname]. How about you?
Suzie told me to come with her to the bar hotel.
Something about discussing for the meeting on Monday.
But I'm a little lazy now.
Is that so? Will you go with her?
{i}What should I do?{/i}
Well, I still have tomorrow anyway. Just stay inside tonight.
I'm sorry honey. I think I should meet her to prepare for work. I will make it up with you later, ok?
Wait a minute, [povname]. Someone's calling.
Okay, honey.
Hi, Alex.
Now?
Okay, let me ask [povname] then.
[povname], Alex asked me to go with him for dinner tonight.
Do you want me to stay here for you or to come with him?
It's up to you but I'd like to hear your voice more.
I think you should go, honey. You should enjoy your life without me, too.
Okay, honey. I'll stay here for you.
[povname] and Emily keep on chatting and the night passes.
Wow honey, it's 9PM now. I think I should eat something and have a rest then.
It's that late now, I didn't notice either!
See you soon, honey.
Yeah, see you.
{i}I miss him so much.{/i}
{i}I wish he was here right now.{/i}
{i}We've been so busy with work.{/i}
{i}It's been a long time since we had some intimacy.{/i}
{i}Oh my, I'm soaking wet down there!{/i}
{i}I only think about him and I'm so horny!{/i}
{i}My body needs him that much?{/i}
{i}I think a little touching won't do any harm, right?{/i}
mmm... mmm...
Lick me, [povname], lick me more... mmm... mmm...
Oh... yes... that's the spot.... mmm.... mmm...
Faster... faster.... yes...
Make me cum... mmm... mmm...
Hmm... This isn't good enough.
I'm not satisfied at all.
I wonder if I should buy a dildo when [povname] is far away...
Meanwhile, at the hotel bar.
So tell me, what brings you here, Suzie?
I'm just on a business trip.
Alone, eh?
With a partner.
So it's now or never for me, right?
Oh, Woody. I have a boyfriend already.
Really? Hmm, let's not think about him tonight.
Sure. And let's not think about anything else. (Suzie giggles)
{i}His touch on my shoulder.{/i}
{i}So forceful and so strong.{/i}
Are you staying in this hotel, too?
Yes, I am.
Good.
Tomorrow I'm busy.
Meet me here on Monday night.
I'll think about that.
Hm. Okay. See you.
See you.
Ok, honey. See you later then.
Emily feels a little bit upset because she thought [povname] would have wanted to chat with her.
At the diner.
That's a funny story, Alex. (Emily giggles).
I wish my love life was that fun, too.
But Suzie's so sweet and beautiful.
Yeah, but she's Asian.
And her old parents taught her not to have sex until marriage. So...
Really? So she's still a virgin until now?
Yeah, I guess so.
And you're a virgin, too? Haha.
Of course not!
Remember that time at school?
Hihi, I'm just messing with you.
Oh, okay.
Meanwhile at the hotel bar.
So tell me, what brings you here, Suzie?
I'm just on a business trip.
Alone, eh?
With a partner.
So it's now or never for me, right?
Oh, Woody. I have a boyfriend already.
Really? Hmm, let's not think about him tonight.
Sure. And let's not think about anything else. (Suzie giggles)
{i}His touch on my shoulder.{/i}
{i}So forceful and so strong.{/i}
Are you staying in this hotel, too?
Yes, I am.
Good.
Tomorrow I'm busy.
Meet me here on Monday night.
I'll think about that.
Hm. Okay. See you.
See you.
Ok, honey. Bye.
Emily feels a little bit upset because she thought [povname] would have wanted to chat with her.
At the bar.
Okay. That's the plan.
I'm going to use the restroom now.
Please wait for me here.
Sure.
10 minutes later.
Hmm. It seems that someone's making a move on her.
Should I intervene?
Hmm, I think I should help Alex keep an eye on her.
Nah, I think she has the right to have some fun, too. If something goes wrong, she will call me.
So tell me, what brings you here, Suzie?
I'm just on a business trip.
Alone, eh?
With a partner.
So it's now or never for me, right?
Oh, Woody. I have a boyfriend already.
Really? Hmm, let's not think about him tonight.
Sure. And let's not think about anything else. (Suzie giggles)
{i}His touch on my shoulder.{/i}
{i}So forceful and so strong.{/i}

Yes, I am.
Good.
Tomorrow I'm busy.
Meet me here on Monday night.
I'll think about that.
Hm. Okay. See you.
See you.
Meanwhile, at the diner.
That's a funny story, Alex. (Emily giggles).
I wish my love life was that fun, too.
But Suzie's so sweet and beautiful.
Yeah, but she's Asian.
And her old parents taught her not to have sex until marriage. So...
Really? So she's still a virgin until now?
Yeah, I guess so.
And you're a virgin, too? Haha.
Of course not!
Remember that time at school?
Hihi, I'm just messing with you.
Oh, okay.
Hey man, she's got a boyfriend already.
Oh, you're her man?
Actually, no.
Woody, this is my colleague, [povname].
[povname], this is Woody George.
And we're discussing about some business stuff.
So, would you please?
Sure, have a good time.
See you later, Suzie.
See you.
{i}Fucking bastard!{/i}
{i}Haha. Look at his face!{/i}
You and Suzie keep on chatting and the night passes.
Meanwhile, at the diner.
That's a funny story, Alex. (Emily giggles).
I wish my love life was that fun, too.
But Suzie's so sweet and beautiful.
Yeah, but she's Asian.

Yeah, I guess so.
And you're a virgin, too? Haha.
Of course not!
Remember that time at school?
Hihi, I'm just messing with you.
Oh, okay.
On Monday, you and Suzie meet Jim Brie, the customer that your company is trying to sign a contract.
Good good. I like the way it is. So soft.
{i}Soft?{/i}
I mean so smooth, the plan's so smooth. Haha.
Y... yeah.......
{i}Hmm, why's her face so weird?{/i}
Do you squat, Ms Lee?
Yes, I do... sometimes...
{i}What the fuck is that question?{/i}
So that's why those are soft but firm. Haha.
{i}Since Suzie is the one dealing with this customer, I can't say much.{/i}
{i}But something's wrong.{/i}
{i}Now when I think about that, why is his hand behind her back?{/i}
{i}Should I check?{/i}
{i}I think I should check to make sure.{/i}
{i}No, let her deal with him.{/i}
{i}She's an adult and she knows what to do.{/i}
{i}Doesn't [povname] know that I need his help?{/i}
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}He's squeezing her butt!{/i}
{i}What an asshole!{/i}
Now tell me, Ms Lee.
Will this plan help my company attract more clients?
Of course, Mr Brie.
We're a professional company and we know how to deal in this kind of situation.
{i}Know how to deal in this kind of situation?{/i}
{i}Is she telling me to just let her deal in this situation?{/i}
{i}Should I help her or let her deal in this situation on her own?{/i}
{i}I think I should help her.{/i}
{i}No, that's none of my business.{/i}
You move in between them.
Jim Brie removes his hand from Suzie but he doesn't look happy at all.
Did you tell him the outcomes of all the possibilities, Ms Lee?
I'm telling him now. Thanks, [povname].
{i}Fuck you, bastard!{/i}
{i}Thanks a lot, [povname]!{/i}
{i}I hope that this incident won't ruin our chance with him.{/i}
{i}I don't wanna get fired from helping her.{/i}
{i}She'll learn on her own and know what to do in this business.{/i}
{i}[povname] doesn't help me. What can I do now?{/i}
At the hotel lobby that night.
Hi, Suzie.
Hi, [povname].
Where are you going, Suzie?
Woody asked me to meet him at the bar.
The guy you met last time, right?
Yeah.
{i}Hmm... Should I let her meet that guy?{/i}
{i}Well, that's her life.{/i}
{i}If I let her go, I'll have to spend the night alone.{/i}
None of your business.
Where were you when I needed your help?
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}Maybe she's still upset about this morning incident.{/i}
Why don't you join me rather than meeting him?
That's great!
{i}I'd like to be with an acquaintance rather than a stranger.{/i}
May I ask you something?
Sure, Suzie.
I... as you know...
Mr Brie had some... inappropriate behaviors toward me this morning.
I didn't know how to react.
I was so scared that I could harm the contract.
{i}Hmm. She needs my advice.{/i}
{i}Should I tell her to defend herself or to do anything she can to keep the client?{/i}
{i}She should defend.{/i}
{i}She should keep the client.{/i}
You should protect yourself, Suzie.
I can't be everywhere around you all the time.
I think you're right.
Thank you.
You should make sure our chance to work with him is okay, Suzie.
Sometimes we have to sacrifice.
I think you're right.
{i}So no one will be on my side.{/i}
{i}I'm a little bit sad.{/i}
At 10pm.
It's late now.
We should go back.
Yeah, thank you. Good night.
At that moment, you suddenly realize she's so cute.
You want to kiss her like she's your girlfriend.
But it isn't right to do that to your best friend's girl.
{i}Maybe a small perk on the cheek is okay, right?{/i}
{i}What am I waiting for?{/i}
{i}No no, I shouldn't!{/i}
Good night.
You lean forward and kiss Suzie's cheek.
Good night, Suzie.
Um.
{i}Why did he do that?{/i}
{i}But he's so bold.{/i}
{i}I like strong men.{/i}
{i}No, Suzie. What are you thinking?{/i}
{i}You're dating Alex now!{/i}
Okay, have fun. See you later.
See you.
{i}I'm so lonely.{/i}
{i}I have to make friends with a stranger here.{/i}
Later at the bar.
May I ask you something?
Sure, Suzie.
I... as you know...
My client had some... inappropriate behaviors towards me this morning.
I don't know how to react.
I was so scared that I could harm the contract.
What the fuck did he do, Suzie?
If he continues to do anything, just call me.
You have my number.
I'll punch him in the face.
No one touches my friend!
You're so sweet, Woody.
Thank you.
At 10pm.
It's late now.
We should go back.
Yeah, thank you. Good night.
Suddenly, Woody leans forward and kisses Suzie's cheek.
Good night, Suzie.
Uhm.
{i}Why did he do that?{/i}
{i}But he's so bold.{/i}
{i}I like strong men.{/i}
{i}No, Suzie. What are you thinking?{/i}
{i}You're dating Alex now!{/i}
Meanwhile, at Emily's home.
{i}Hmm, this is the first time I bought a dildo.{/i}
{i}It's a little bigger than that thing of my boyfriend though.{/i}
{i}I hope it won't hurt me.{/i}
{i}Mmm. My pussy is soaking wet already.{/i}
{i}This is all [povname]'s fault!{/i}
{i}I'm so horny.{/i}
{i}Maybe I should lick the dildo first.{/i}
{i}I don't wanna get hurt.{/i}
{i}It's time now.{/i}
{i}Tear apart my pussy, Mr Dildo!{/i}
Ouch!!!
{i}It's in!{/i}
{i}My vagina has never been this full before!{/i}
{i}I'm moving now, Mr Dildo!{/i}
Oh... oh... oh...
Yeah... so good... Mmm...
You're stretching me, Mr Dildo... Mmm...
Oh my...
This is so good...
I'm moving faster now...
Mr Dildo, I'm going faster now...
Ah... ah...
I've never felt this good...
Something's coming...
Mmm... mmm...
Mr Dildo...
I'm coming...
I'M COMINGGGGG...
MMM... MMM...
AAAHHHHH.....
I'M COMINGGG.....
Feeling ignored by you, Emily accepts to have a drink with Alex that night.
You know I still have feelings for you, right, Emily?
Alex, you're drunk.
But I'm telling the truth.
You have Suzie now.
Not sure about that. We've only known each other for a short time.
And I don't like her life style much.
Maybe I prefer a girl like you.
Suzie will be upset if she hears you say that, you know?
It'll hurt her more if I keep on lying to her and to you about my feelings.
I think you're right.
But that was the past. I have [povname] now.
Where's he when you need him?
Well. I think he's busy.
{i}I think Alex's right though.{/i}
You think?
Ever since high school, I've always been around you when you need someone.
Why didn't you choose me?
Love is hard to say, Alex.
And I think you're drunk.
We should go home.
Suddenly Alex leans over and tries to kiss Emily.
Mmm...
What the hell, Alex?
I... I'm sorry Emily.
I think I'm drunk. We should go home now.
Later that night.
{i}Does Alex still have feeling for me?{/i}
The following day, Mr Brie invites you and Suzie to a diner to discuss more about the deal.
Upon arrival, you see Mr Brie has already been sitting at a table.
I'm over here. Ms Lee, sit here.
{i}He's a pervert. Should I let her sit next to him?{/i}
{i}Nope. I'd better take that place.{/i}
{i}Yeah. He can't do anything right before my eyes.{/i}
Ms Lee doesn't feel so well today.
She needs to sit alone to feel comfortable.
It seems that I have to sit with you, Mr Brie.
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
We should keep him in a good mood to get the deal.
Go sit next to him, Suzie.
Reluctantly, Suzie sits down beside Mr Brie.
{i}What a pair of boobs, haha.{/i}
{i}Short skirt, eh? I wonder how tight those thighs are.{/i}
Mr Brie's hand starts to move. He places it on her thighs, enjoying her soft skin.
{i}So smooth. Haha.{/i}
{i}What's he doing?{/i}
{i}What's that? He's doing that right before my eyes?{/i}
{i}Why doesn't [povname] do anything? I'm so scared.{/i}
Sorry... I... I must use the restroom.
Hey, wait.
Well. I've gotta pee also.
{i}Is he trying to follow Suzie?{/i}
{i}Should I hold him back to help Suzie?{/i}
{i}Of course I must hold him back.{/i}
{i}Nope. I don't think he dares to do anything.{/i}
Ah Mr Brie, wait.
What?
There are some urgent things that we need to discuss.
I only need 5 minutes, so please wait.
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
Haha, wait for me.
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}Who's that guy?{/i}
How could you come here quick right after I called you, Woody?
I was buying some stuff right on the street.
That's so lucky for me.
Thanks again for coming, Woody.
No big deal. You're my friend, Suzie.
{i}There she is. Haha.{/i}
{i}I was so scared.{/i}
AHHH....
What are you doing here, Mr Brie?
Relax, I'm just here to pee.
Yeah... I'll go out for you to use the restroom.
But Mr Brie doesn't move a muscle.
Please... I must go.
You're so beautiful!
Th... thanks. Please let me go.
Especially your tits.
Ah...
Stop it, Mr Brie!
I'm not that kind of girl!
Hm?
{i}You'll be that kind of girl soon.{/i}
{i}I wonder what [povname]'s doing right now.{/i}
{i}I'll call him then.{/i}
Hi babe.
How are you?
I'm fine, lying on my bed now.
The closet is broken.
What's that just now?
Is there anyone else with you?
{i}Shit!{/i}
No, I'm all alone!
Are you sure?
I think I heard a girl's voice.
I'm pretty sure, Emily.
That was just the television.
It's late now. I have to rest.
Good night, babe.
Good night, sweetheart.
{i}I'm pretty sure that was a familiar voice.{/i}
{i}Was that Suzie?{/i}
{i}The bastard didn't sign the contract so we had to stay back.{/i}
{i}The problem was that we only booked for 3 nights.{/i}
{i}When we wanted to stay for another night, all rooms were booked.{/i}
{i}Luckily, there's an available room in this cheap motel, which isn't far from that bastard's place.{/i}
{i}But there's only one room so I have to share it with Suzie.{/i}
{i}I can't let Emily know about this.{/i}
{i}She's so jealous and Suzie doesn't want Alex to know.{/i}
Good night, [povname].
Good night, Suzie.
It's lucky that this bed is big enough for both of us.
Yeah.
{i}It's good that she has no problem sleeping in the same bed with me.{/i}
{i}Or else I must sleep on the floor.{/i}
15 minutes later, after several attempts to sleep...
{i}Hmm... I can't sleep.{/i}
{i}Her smell's so good, it's intoxicating.{/i}
{i}I wonder if that bastard Alex had the chance to have some fun with her or not.{/i}
{i}They've been dating for merely 2 weeks.{/i}
{i}Not long enough for some girls to accept more than just kissing.{/i}
{i}Oh shit. I've got a boner.{/i}
{i}She's so attractive!{/i}
{i}Alex's so lucky.{/i}
{i}Has she been sleeping already?{/i}
{i}Hmm... I guess I'll get closer to have a better look at her?{/i}
{i}Sure, why not?{/i}
{i}No, I won't.{/i}
{i}She's so cute from this angle.{/i}
{i}I wish I could just...{/i}
What are you doing, [povname]?
Uh... uhm...
Please sleep, we'll have things to do tomorrow.
Uhm... okay...
What are you doing, [povname]?
Uh... uhm...
Please sleep, [povname]...
{i}Shit, she's so cute.{/i}
{i}I'm too horny now.{/i}
{i}She's not looking at me.{/i}
{i}Maybe she's horny too but she's shy.{/i}
{i}Should I make a move now?{/i}
{i}Yeah, I think that's what she wants now.{/i}
{i}No, I should behave myself and go back to sleep.{/i}
Suddenly, you hold her cheek and your face approaches hers.
Er?
Surprisingly, Suzie accepts your kiss.
You taste her lips and explores the depth of her mouth.
You're lost in passion.
Your tongues intertwine and her breath escalates strongly.
Suddenly, she removes herself from your kiss.
But her heart's racing.
You can feel her heartbeats.
You're overwhelmed by desire.
You think of uncovering her breasts, to see what are inside the pink pajama.
Will you do that?
{i}Why not?{/i}
{i}No, I should stop here.{/i}
{i}Her nipple's hard already!{/i}
{i}So cute.{/i}
{i}Why is [povname] doing this?{/i}
{i}Why haven't I stopped him?{/i}
{i}It feels so...{/i}
{i}Does he like what he sees?{/i}
Realizing that she doesn't protest, you want to feel her breast, the first Asian breast in your life.
Will you do that?
{i}She wants me to touch her for sure!{/i}
{i}No no, I should stop here before everything gets out of control.{/i}
Without any protests, Suzie gives a soft moan.
Um...
Your breast's so soft.
And beautiful!
No, [povname]. Please stop.
{i}Stop? Stop now?{/i}
{i}She doesn't want more?{/i}
{i}But she still lets me touch her boob.{/i}
{i}Why must I stop?{/i}
Umm...
Seeing that Suzie doesn't say anything, you want to do more.
{i}Her crotch's so inviting, should I feel it?{/i}
{i}I'm too horny, I want to touch her more!{/i}
{i}No, I shouldn't. She might get angry!{/i}
Oh...
No, [povname].
This is wrong.
Sorry, Suzie.
I can't restrain myself.
It's ok. See you tomorrow.
Sure, sleep well, Suzie.
{i}My heart's still racing.{/i}
{i}I can’t believe I told him it was ok.{/i}
{i}Is it something I want him to do again?{/i}
Sorry, Suzie.
Um... I must sleep now.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
Yeah... see you...
{i}My heart's still racing.{/i}
Sorry, Suzie.
Um... I must sleep now.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
Yeah... see you...
{i}My heart's still racing.{/i}
Sorry, Suzie.
Um... I must sleep now.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
Yeah... see you...
{i}My heart's still racing.{/i}
Yeah, sorry.
Sleep well, Suzie.
{i}I must sleep now.{/i}
{i}Tomorrow will be very busy.{/i}
The next day.
Hi, Woody.
I'm stuck now.
All the rooms in the hotel we met were full.
We intended to come home yesterday but we haven't finished the deal so we had to stay back.
We asked to extend our time there but the receptionist said all the rooms were booked so I had to sleep in a cheap motel.
This motel was also full so I must share the room with my colleague.
By any chance, do you know any other hotels in this area?
Your friend left and you had a free room?
Wow, that's great!
Room 69?
Great, I'll be there tonight!
Thank you so much, Woody!
Back home, in the storage room.
Hi Alex.
Hi Emily. Why do you want to meet me here?
Emily pauses, wonders if it's a correct choice to discuss what she's suspecting with Alex.
However, she can't stand it anymore so she starts to speak.
I don't want all of the company to know about this.
About what? Emily?
Have you kept in touch with Suzie over the past few days?
No, not really. I don't wanna distract her.
{i}Suzie is his girlfriend. How will he respond to this?{/i}
... Last night, when I called [povname], I think I heard Suzie's voice in his room.
Maybe they were discussing something.
Alex sounds rational, but suspicious thoughts start to form in his mind.
It was 10PM.
It's weird. Did you ask [povname] about that?
Yes, I did. But he claimed that there was only him inside the room and the voice was coming from the television...
But you didn't believe that?
Emily pauses to think. Did she just overreact?
Maybe you were just hearing things or it was just the television.
You should trust him. I've known him for long. He'll never betray us.
{i}He betrayed me in the past when he stole you from me!{/i}
If you said so. Maybe I'm just thinking too much.
Thank you, Alex.
Don't worry, Emily. He'll come back soon.
{i}I still think there was something fishy.{/i}
{i}What the fuck did [povname] do this time?{/i}
That night.
I wonder why you two still want to meet me.
The deal was over.
There's nothing to discuss.
Mr Brie, please don't worry.
Tonight we only want to discuss the last details of the contract so you can decide to work with us or not.
Is that so?
Well then, have a drink with me.
I can't discuss or talk or do anything without some drink.
Umm.. Sorry... I really can't drink.
What? You refuse my kindness?
{i}Is that how you describe 'kindness'?{/i}
No no, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Girls where I come from rarely drink and I really can't drink.
You're not in that country anymore, are you?
Just a sip is okay.
If you deny my request, how can I accept your deal?
{i}Hmm... Should I intervene?{/i}
{i}I should help her.{/i}
{i}There's no need to.{/i}
Mr Brie. In some cultures, girls can't drink.
But I'm happy to accept your request and drink with you.
Let the respect and the drinks flow around, shall we?
{i}What a jerk!{/i}
Mr Brie keeps on pouring more shots.
He thinks that you won't be able to drink anymore and will let Suzie drink.
But to protect Suzie, you keep on drinking for her.
Until...
He's passed out...
{i}Stupid... Fuck!{/i}
Mr Brie, would you please help me carry him?
I'll call a taxi.
Alright.
{i}Fuck you, stupid, crazy...{/i}
30 minutes later...
Thank you for saving me, [povname].
I didn't know what to do back then.
zzzz....
Good night.
If I have just a sip, you will discuss with us, won't you, Mr Brie?
Sure. I'm a man of my words.
Uhm...
Ugh... I don't feel well.
First time drinking. Don't worry.
Alright, now you can tell me about the deal.
But just 15 minutes later...
What? Just a shot and she's drunk?
Let me help you, my dear.
Thanks, Mr Bee. Um... Sorry... Mr Brie.
{i}She can't think straight anymore.{/i}
{i}Will I let him take her away just like that?{/i}
{i}I can't stop him.{/i}
{i}No, I can't let him do anything to her.{/i}
{i}I feel a little bit guilty letting him take her away.{/i}
{i}I hope it'll save our deal.{/i}
{i}Sorry, Suzie.{/i}
Later, at Mr Brie's house.
Well well well.
The beauty is sleeping on my sofa.
She looks so delicious.
I've never tasted any Asian girl.
Let's move your arm, my girl.
I wanna see you clearer.
You smell so good.
What are you dreaming about now?
Nice tits.
Not too big.
But nice.
They say Asian girls has small breasts and tight pussies.
Let's discover more, shall we?
Um...
Black panty.
Let's take it off.
Um...
Nice...
I must be careful not to wake her up.
Ummm......
It's time to see if your pussy is as tight as people say or not.
Er?
Oh, you're awake.
Ouch...
Do you want me to call the police?
No no, this is just a mistake.
{i}I thought she was a shy girl and wouldn't get angry.{/i}
Mistake?
I.. uh... it was hot, so I took off your clothes for you.
Bullshit!
If I catch you do anything like this to any girl, I'll make sure you'll spend the rest of your life in jail!
Alright... alright...
30 minutes later, when you're about to sleep, suddenly Suzie appears at the door.
Oh, Suzie, you're back!
{i}She looks angry.{/i}
I'm back?
Is that the only thing you can say?
Uh...
I can't believe you let him take me to his house.
I... I'm sorry...
I thought...
Save it.
I don't wanna hear anything from you.
I'll pack my stuff and go in the morning.
Now, move away.
I'll sleep in the bed and you'll sleep on the floor.
Okay...
No, Mr Brie.
We don't wanna bother you.
I'll bring her back to the motel.
Thanks for your kindness.
{i}What the fuck is wrong with him?{/i}
... Room 69... to Woody...
{i}Hmm, will I take her to Woody's place or bring her back to the motel?{/i}
{i}I must do what she wants.{/i}
{i}Nope. Why must I bring her to another man?{/i}
At room 69.
Hi, uh...
Woody.
Yeah. Hi, Woody.
Is Suzie drunk?
She didn't say that you would come here.
Actually, I only carry her here because she's drunk.
Oh. I'm happy to hear that.
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
Lay her down on the bed.
Okay.
And leave.
{i}Bastard!{/i}
Done.
You know where the door is.
{i}Mother f...{/i}
Hey, Suzie, wake up.
Huh? Where am I?
You're at my friend's room.
Oh, Woody...
Are you okay now?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Good, sleep well.
See you in the morning.
See you.
{i}Why did he leave so soon?{/i}
{i}What is this strange feeling?{/i}
Next morning.
Hi, Mr Park.
Uhm... Because...
I understand...
A few minutes later.
Hi, Woody.
Hi, Suzie.
Did you sleep well?
Yeah. Thank you.
But...
What's wrong?
My boss said if I couldn't make the client sign the contract, my contract will be terminated.
He said so?
Yeah, since it's only a trial contract.
Don't worry.
Listen, just go back.
I'll make sure he won't fire you.
Thank you.
You're so sweet.
{i}I know he just wants to cheer me up.{/i}
{i}But I also think I should go back then.{/i}
An hour later.
There you go.
{i}She's so cute.{/i}
{i}Hm... She smells so good.{/i}
Er?
What are you doing, [povname]?
Something inside you makes you want to kiss her.
{i}No, I should behave myself.{/i}
{i}Why not?{/i}
I just want to say good night.
Umm... Good night, [povname].
Good night.
Without answering her question, you start to kiss her.
Er?
Maybe because of the drink, she accepts your kiss.
Oh, [povname].
Please stop.
She doesn't look like she wants to stop at all.
{i}No, I should behave myself.{/i}
{i}Am I not manly enough?{/i}
Umm... Good night, [povname].
Good night.
Oh?
[povname], what are you doing?
What about Emily?
{i}I love Emily.{/i}
{i}I like Suzie.{/i}
I love her.
Then please don't do this.
And please, I want to have some sleep.
Uhm, okay. Good night.
I really like you.
Um... Thank you.
As a friend, I like you, too.
I'm going to sleep now.
Sure. Good night.
Good night.
Next morning.
Hi, Mr Park.
Uhm... Because...
I understand...
Alex, Mr Park just called me.
If I can't sign the contract with Mr Brie, my contract will be terminated since it's only a trial contract.
But if I don't have a job, I may be forced to move back to my country.
You'll help me?
Thank you, you're so sweet.
I'll pack my stuff and go home now.
[povname], Mr Park just called me.
What did he say, Suzie?
If I can't sign the contract with Mr Brie, my contract will be terminated since it's only a trial contract.
What?
What should I do now, [povname]?
Let's pack our stuff and go home.
Let's go see Mr Brie one last time.
But...
Don't worry, I'll talk to Mr Park.
Thank you.
But why do you always help me?
What do you think about me?
Because you're my friend.
Because I like you and want to take care of you.
Um... Thank you.
Um... Thank you.
I don't think I can change anything, but if you say so...
At Mr Brie's house.
Hm? Why are you here?
We want to discuss with you about the contract.
Please give us this one last chance.
We just need some minutes.
Hm. I'm going out soon.
Now, you, I don't remember your name.
{i}Bastard!{/i}
Sit there.
Ms Lee, sit here with me.
No, she'll sit next to me.
Sit with him, Suzie.
Get out! You're wasting my time!
But...
That's okay. Don't worry.
I'm here for you.
Why are you looking at the door, Ms Lee?
I...
I think in East Asia, people are so friendly, right?
Yeah, I guess...
Then sit close to me.
Er?
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}What will I do now?{/i}
Mr Brie, please behave yourself!
{i}I think it's not a big deal sitting closer.{/i}
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
Oh, Suzie. Alex's calling you now.
Oh, my hand slips.
Oh, Suzie. Alex's calling you now.
Hi, Alex.
Yeah, Mr Park said so.
Ah?
No, there's nothing.
I've gotta go now. I'll call you back later.
{i}He's doing that right before my eyes.{/i}
{i}What am I gonna do now?{/i}
Mr Brie, that's enough!
{i}I don't think he dares do more.{/i}
Stop it before I kick your ass.
Grrrr...
You both get out of my house!
{i}He took off my skirt!{/i}
{i}What will I do now?{/i}
{i}I'm scared but I don't wanna lose this job!{/i}
{i}Maybe I just let him have what he wants...{/i}
Bend down, girl!
Er?
{i}He's shoving her forward!{/i}
{i}Am I just letting him fuck her like this?{/i}
That's too far, Mr Brie!
{i}Maybe she wants this?{/i}
Stop it before I punch you in the face!
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, YOU STUPID PEOPLE!!!
{i}He's rubbing his... thing between my ass cheeks!{/i}
{i}He's starting to fuck her for sure now!{/i}
{i}I don't know what to do now!{/i}
{i}But why doesn't she say anything?{/i}
{i}I don't wanna go back to my home country!{/i}
{i}Is she accepting this?{/i}
{i}But [povname]'s looking at me...{/i}
{i}I think she'll let him fuck her for sure!{/i}
{i}But do I let him have her just like this? What will Alex say if he finds out?{/i}
Stop it, Mr Brie!
{i}I guess she's okay with this since she doesn't say anything.{/i}
AHHHH.
GET OUT, GET OUT!!!
BOTH OF YOU!
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!!!
{i}I think he's going to penetrate me!{/i}
{i}I haven't done this before!{/i}
{i}They say it'll be hurt!{/i}
It's time for you to eat, my little boy.
Ohhh.....
Ahh... It's so tight.
I can't enter you!
With a hard push...
Ahhh.....
It's good to go now.
{i}My virginity...{/i}
Is my dick too big for you, Ms Lee?
Huff... huff... y... yeah...
{i}It's hurt...{/i}
Is it bigger than [povname]'s?
Huff... I... huff... never slept... with him... huff...
{i}They're fucking as if I'm invisible!{/i}
What?
{i}Is [povname] looking at me?{/i}
He didn't fuck you?
{i}I'm so ashamed!{/i}
Stupid! Haha.
{i}He's moving faster now!{/i}
Ah... I'm coming...
Oh... oh... oh...
{i}Is he going to come inside her?{/i}
{i}His... thing is bigger now, I feel it...{/i}
OHHHH....
UMMMM...
{i}Shit! It looks like he came inside her.{/i}
Oh ho... I just took your virgin?
{i}What? She was still a virgin? What did I do?{/i}
{i}I'm not a virgin anymore...{/i}
You and Suzie go back to the motel.
Please don't tell anyone, [povname].
Especially Alex.
Listen, I...
Don't.
I just wanna be alone now.
Hmm... I didn't think that I would make this call.
Hi, Woody.
Why are you making a video call to me?
Are you accepting it now?
On the next Sunday morning, after [povname] and Suzie came back to their town.
{i}What a week.{/i}
{i}That bastard Jim Brie in the end didn't sign the contract.{/i}
{i}Well, it had nothing to do with me though.{/i}
{i}But I'm not sure about Suzie.{/i}
{i}That was her first real deal and it failed.{/i}
{i}Well, the first morning back home.{/i}
{i}I haven't seen Emily for a whole week.{/i}
{i}But it seems that Suzie needs someone to talk to after a disastrous week.{/i}
{i}Should I ask Emily out or should I invite Suzie?{/i}
{i}I miss Emily, I wanna see her.{/i}
{i}A friend in need is a friend indeed. I'll call Suzie then.{/i}
Suzie's phone is ringing.
Hi, [povname].
Hi, Suzie. How are you today?
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
Do you want to have dinner with me?
Me?
How about... Emily?
You don't wanna go?
Yes, I want to. But I...
What is it, Suzie?
It's near the end of the month so I don't have much money left to call a taxi...
Don't worry, I'll pick you up.
That's great, [povname]! What time will you come to my place?
Is 6PM ok?
It's ok. I'll be ready at that time.
Ok, cool. See you then.
Yeah, see you.
{i}It's 5:30 now.{/i}
{i}I'll walk to the parking lot and drive to her place.{/i}
{i}She lives not far from here. I'll make it in time.{/i}
{i}Alex told me that she lived with some friends from college.{/i}
{i}It must be tough for a girl living far away from home like her.{/i}
{i}There she is.{/i}
{i}What a cute girl!{/i}
{i}She's waiting for me at the door already.{/i}
{i}It's not 6PM yet.{/i}
{i}Emily always makes me wait for at least 30 minutes before going out.{/i}
{i}I think I should go out to greet her.{/i}
Hi, Suzie.
Hi, [povname].
Wow, you're so cute in this skirt.
Um... thanks...
Ok, let's go.
Sure.
That table is available.
Do you mind sitting in a corner, Suzie?
I'm fine, don't worry.
Let's sit there then.
What do you want to eat now, Suzie?
Er, I'm not good at choosing.
Would you please choose it for me?
Oh, ok, sure.
{i}Hm, Emily isn't like that at all.{/i}
{i}She always instructs me what to do, which to choose...{/i}
{i}I wonder if all Asian girls are like Suzie.{/i}
{i}Hm, she looks a little bit down.{/i}
{i}I think she has something in her mind right now.{/i}
Hey, Suzie. Are you ok?
I'm ok, [povname].
But you look sad.
Yeah, I'm worried...
About the deal, right?
Don't worry.
There are many jobs in this country, you know.
But I'm not a citizen here.
If he fires me, I won't have money to pay the rent.
The worst thing is that I might have to go back to my country if I can't get a job.
{i}Shit. I forgot that she's here alone. No relative or relation.{/i}
Don't worry, I'm the sales manager.
He must listen to my idea before terminating your contract.
And I'll make sure that it won't happen.
{i}I hope he'll listen to me.{/i}
Really?
Really.
Thank you, [povname].
Thank you for taking me home, [povname].
{i}Hm... She's still sad.{/i}
{i}But looking from this angle, she's so attractive.{/i}
{i}Her boobs are a little bit smaller than Emily's, but they still look delicious, hehe.{/i}
{i}Asian girls tend to have small breasts.{/i}
{i}I think she's one of the big-breasted Asian girls then.{/i}
{i}I really want to touch those tits.{/i}
{i}But it's not wise to do that right before her door.{/i}
{i}Maybe a kiss on the cheek now?{/i}
{i}No, no, no... Let's just go home.{/i}
{i}Let's do it.{/i}
Um...
Er... Good night, [povname].
Good night.
{i}What a cute girl!{/i}
{i}She's still a bit shy although we spent a whole week together.{/i}
Good night, [povname].
Good night.
Suzie's phone is ringing.
{i}Hm... Why doesn't she answer the phone?{/i}
{i}Maybe she's tired.{/i}
{i}Well, if so, I'll call Emily then.{/i}
Suzie's phone is ringing.
Hi, [povname].
Hi, Suzie. How are you today?
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
Do you want to have dinner with me?
I... er...
{i}We're only colleagues.{/i}
{i}That wouldn't be good at all.{/i}
Um... I'm sorry.
I'm... busy tonight.
Oh, ok.
See you tomorrow at work then.
Yeah, see you.
{i}Well, if so, I'll call Emily then.{/i}
Emily's phone is ringing.
Hi, babe.
Hi, babe.
Do you know that I'm waiting for your call?
Yes, I know.
Are you free today?
No, I'm busy.
Oh.
I'm busy waiting to go out with you.
Oh my. You're joking.
Hihi. Where will we meet, babe?
The restaurant which Alex usually hangs out with us, ok?
Sure. 6PM, ok?
Ok.
{i}I guess she'll come around 6:30.{/i}
{i}It's 5:30 now.{/i}
{i}I'll walk to the parking lot and drive to the restaurant.{/i}
{i}I hope Emily won't make me wait too long like usual.{/i}
{i}That table's available.{/i}
{i}I'll sit there and hope Emily won't be too late then.{/i}
How long have you been here?
It's ok. Just 30 minutes, I guess.
I'm sorry, [povname].
Don't be mad at me, babe.
Alright, babe.
Let's make an order, shall we?
Ok, babe.
Where's the waiter?
I remember his name is Edgar or something.
{i}Oh, wow!{/i}
{i}Why is there a school girl here?{/i}
{i}With that outfit, I guess she's studying at Saint Patrick's High School.{/i}
{i}What a big butt and a pair of huge tits!{/i}
{i}Hmm? What's he looking at?{/i}
{i}I really want to touch that butt once.{/i}
{i}But is it ok for me to look at a girl's butt like this?{/i}
{i}I should stop. My dignity doesn't allow me to do this.{/i}
{i}Hell yeah. I'm pretty sure she loves to be looked at!{/i}
{i}Oh my...{/i}
{i}I wish I could touch that butt once.{/i}
{i}Oh shit!{/i}.
{i}I think she knew I was looking at that girl's butt.{/i}
You'll never change, [povname]!
You look at another girl's butt even when you're sitting with your girlfriend!
Listen, babe. I was just...
No, I won't listen.
You always behave like that.
I'm out of here!
Hey, babe!
{i}What the fuck!{/i}
{i}There goes the romantic night.{/i}
{i}As I know her, she'll be cool off tomorrow if I leave her alone.{/i}
{i}If I chase her now, everything'll just get worse.{/i}
{i}Well, I'll just have dinner alone and come home then.{/i}
I... er... I'm sorry... Hihi.
Just got here but I have to use the restroom now.
Wait for me here, please.
Sure, honey.
I'll be back soon.
{i}Hm, waiting, waiting forever.{/i}
{i}I'm getting bored now.{/i}
{i}Think about that, I didn't have a chance to have some intimacy with her the past few days.{/i}
{i}Should I follow her to surprise her?{/i}
{i}What am I waiting for? Let's go.{/i}
{i}No no no. I don't wanna be called a pervert!{/i}
After Emily comes back, you and Emily have dinner and go back to your place.
{i}Hmm. The restroom here is so big.{/i}
{i}I hope there's no one else inside except Emily.{/i}
{i}Even if there is, I'll just say that I go to the wrong door.{/i}
{i}Lame excuse I guess.{/i}
{i}But Emily will back me up for sure.{/i}
{i}Hmm. She's not here.{/i}
{i}Maybe she's on the other side.{/i}
{i}There she is, washing her hands.{/i}
Er? What are you doing here, [povname]?
I'm looking for you, of course.
But this is the women's restroom.
Are you insane?
There's no one else here, don't worry.
You're joking, right?
What if you get caught?
You won't let that happen, will you?
Er, I think I'm hearing women's voices coming this way.
What now then, [povname]?
Quick, get inside, Emily.
You smell good tonight, Emily.
Er, why are you standing so close to me?
It's been a long time.
I know, but we're in a restroom with people outside.
{i}Why do I want to pull off her top right now?{/i}
{i}I think a week without touching her makes me want to do crazy things.{/i}
{i}I want to have her right here right now.{/i}
{i}Just do it.{/i}
{i}Let's be patient, a long night is waiting for me.{/i}
Um...
I know what you're thinking.
I want it to, babe.
But let's finish our dinner.
We have a long night.
Okay, let's wait until they leave.
Okay.
Don't worry, babe. They're outside, we're inside.
Hey?
What are you doing, [povname]?
I love you, babe.
I know what you're thinking.
I want it to, babe.
But let's finish our dinner first.
We have a long night.
Er...
Let's wait until they leave.
Um... okay.
Here we are, my humble room.
Can't compare to your house, babe.
You just lay your books everywhere as usual.
How long will I have to clean your place every time I come here, [povname]?
Just leave it as it is, babe.
I think this place is neat already.
You call this neat?
{i}Finally, alone with her.{/i}
{i}I'll hug her from behind.{/i}
Hey, babe.
Yeah?
I want to have a shower first.
Oh... okay...
I'll wait here.
Don't come inside, okay?
Sure, I know you don't like that.
Thanks, [povname].
After Emily finishes bathing, you also have a shower.
{i}Yeah, I'm all clean now.{/i}
{i}Hmm... She's not here?{/i}
{i}Maybe she's on the bed already.{/i}
{i}That's right.{/i}
{i}The annoyed princess is laying on the bed.{/i}
{i}This view makes me too horny.{/i}
{i}I want to penetrate her immediately!{/i}
{i}But knowing her, she'll never let me do that without a foreplay.{/i}
What took you so long, babe?
It's only 15 minutes, babe.
It's not appropriate to let a girl wait for you even just a minute, [povname].
{i}But if I don't have a shower, you won't let me come near you.{/i}
I'm sorry, babe.
As you're climbing on top of her from behind, Emily says:
No, lie next to me, babe.
Okay, honey.
You smell really good, honey.
Are you sure?
What do you mean?
I'm wondering how many girls' scents you smelled already.
I only have you, babe!
I can't trust men.
Again, honey?
I know your father wasn't a good man.
But I'm not like him.
I'm not sure.
My mom was so naive to trust him.
And I'm thinking I'm so naive sometimes, too.
Who told you that you were naive?
That guy had to be stupid.
What did you say?
{i}Shit, I spoke it out loud!{/i}
{i}If this continues, she'll leave me sleeping alone again.{/i}
{i}It's not the time to be gentle anymore.{/i}
What are you doing?
I'm doing what a man should do with his girlfriend.
Umm...
{i}Her lips are so sweet tonight!{/i}
After some minutes...
You're weird tonight, [povname]!
No, I'm not.
I'm just loving you.
Let's get the towel out of the way.
Out of the way for what?
For this...
While you're sucking her right nipple, your right hand starts to squeeze her left breast.
Oh... Easy...
Umm... Don't bite me...
As she starts to breathe heavily...
Your little girl is as cute as always.
Don't say that, I'm embarrassed!
Move apart your thighs, Emily.
No, I won't...
Hey, I told you that I wouldn't...
It's ok, I'll spread your legs for you.
No!
Ah...
{i}I knew it!{/i}
{i}Just sucking her pussy and she'll stop complaining.{/i}
Umm... [povname]...
Are you ready, Emily?
Um...
{i}Don't answer is her way of saying she's ready.{/i}
{i}Are you ready, my boy?{/i}
Ah...
I'm going in now.
Aahhh...
Wow, you're so tight tonight.
I guess your girl is missing me, eh?
Don't say that!
Alright.
{i}I guess more than a week without doing it makes it tighter than usual.{/i}
With a hard push...
Ouch...
I'm moving now, babe.
Don't tell me that...
Huff... huff...
You're so tight tonight.
I... huff... know...
I've never felt you as tight as this before...
Stop... huff... saying... that...
Do you feel good, honey?
Yes... huff... good... ummm...
Am I the best, huh?
You're... the only... huff... man... I've ever... huff...
Stop saying... huff... that... um...
I'm so close...
Me, too... ah....
Are you coming?
Yes... yes... I'm coming...
Aahhh....
Are you on the pill?
I don't care, just come... ahh...
I'm coming now, receiving my seeds, honey!
Give me your face, honey!
Ah...
I'm still mad that you said who told I was naive was crazy.
{i}What? She still remembers even after this?{/i}
Aahhhh...
Ugh...
I'm still mad that you said who told I was naive was crazy.
{i}What? She still remembers even after this?{/i}
{i}Another week.{/i}
{i}This is Olivia Smith, the secretary of Mr Park.{/i}
{i}She's 27 years old.{/i}
{i}I'm not sure when did she start to work here since she was his secretary already when I applied for a position.{/i}
Hi, Olivia.
Hi, [povname].
How are you today?
No time for that now, [povname].
Mr Park and everyone are waiting for you in the conference room.
Why is there a meeting so early in the morning?
I'm not sure, Mr Park only told me to tell you that.
Okay. Thanks, Olivia.
You're welcome.
{i}Hmm? Everyone except Alex is here already.{/i}
{i}Who is this bald guy?{/i}
{i}We're waiting for you. Sit down, please.{/i}
{i}We'll start the announcement right away.{/i}
Sure, Mr Park.
{i}Where should I sit now?{/i}
{i}Of course, I must sit next to my girlfriend.{/i}
{i}Suzie is worried. I should sit next to her to calm her down.{/i}
Hi, babe.
Hi.
Hi, Suzie.
Hi, [povname].
{i}Uh oh... Not good for sure.{/i}
Okay, everyone's here.
It's time for the announcement.
But Alex's not here yet, Mr Park?
He'll be informed later.
{i}Then why did you wait for me?{/i}
I want to inform that I finally can hire a very talented sales manager.
What?
Welcome, Mr George.
This is the team will work under your guidance from now on.
Alex will meet you later when he comes.
Hi everyone. I'm Woody George.
What about me?
Am I the sales manager here?
Yes, you are demoted.
What? You can't do that!
Yes, I can.
According to the contract, I can demote you or even fire you if the sales number can't meet the target.
Have you checked the sales report for the last quarter?
What about Suzie?
Ms Lee will become Mr George's assistant.
Now everyone can go back to your office.
Is that so?
Ah, Mr George will use your office from now on.
We've prepared a desk for you in the statistic department.
Thanks, Mr Park.
{i}And here I am.{/i}
{i}They don't even give me a laptop.{/i}
{i}I must sit with the statistic guys.{/i}
{i}The only good thing is that Emily is sitting here, too.{/i}
{i}But if I can't do anything to change this situation, maybe he'll sack me one day.{/i}
At 01PM.
{i}It's lunch time now.{/i}
{i}I'm so annoyed. I don't wanna have lunch with Emily at all.{/i}
{i}Maybe I should have a sandwich alone.{/i}
{i}This fucking room.{/i}
{i}I feel so irritated when thinking about this morning.{/i}
{i}Let's get back to work.{/i}
{i}Or let's go the other way to have a look at my old office?{/i}
{i}No, I'll feel more irritated!{/i}
{i}Just a look is ok, I think.{/i}
{i}Let's get back to work.{/i}
{i}I'll find as many customers as I can to keep this job!{/i}
{i}Hm? Some people are chatting inside the storage room?{/i}
{i}Why don't they have lunch at this time?{/i}
{i}Emily?{/i}
{i}Who is she talking to?{/i}
I don't think that's a problem, Emily.
{i}Alex?{/i}
I'm not so sure about that.
He ignored me and went straight to her seat this morning.
I'm still suspecting that there was something happened when I called him last time.
{i}What?{/i}
I think you're just thinking too much.
She was his assistant until this morning, so...
So you think I'm just paranoid?
No, Emily...
Do you know that he hasn't called me or met me since he got home?
I mean...
Ok, I'll investigate this alone.
Wait, Emily...
{i}I should go now before she comes out.{/i}
{i}First, I was demoted.{/i}
{i}Second, Emily is suspecting me cheating on her now.{/i}
{i}What did I do to get myself into these troubles?{/i}
{i}I'm really tired!{/i}
{i}6PM now.{/i}
{i}Hmm...{/i}
{i}Should I go meet Emily to make her trust me more now?{/i}
{i}I'd better go meet her. She's my girlfriend anyway.{/i}
{i}No, I'm too tired.{/i}
{i}Let's call it a day.{/i}
{i}I'm not in the mood to see anyone now.{/i}
{i}Let's go back home.{/i}
{i}Everything will be better tomorrow.{/i}
Hey babe, what are you doing?
Hi, [povname].
{i}Speak of the devil!{/i}
I was about to go home.
{i}I was thinking should I follow him to know if he was cheating on me or not.{/i}
What are you doing here, babe?
I just want to see you.
Was your day good?
{i}He sounds like he's caring for me.{/i}
{i}But I'm starting to suspect he's doing this just to make me think he still loves me.{/i}
Hello, are you still here, Emily?
Oh, yeah.
What is it, babe?
Nothing. It's just that you were silent for a moment.
I'm just tired, that's all.
So we can't have some private times tonight, can we?
I think I can't.
Okay, see you tomorrow then.
See you.
{i}Hmm... Good old days...{/i}
{i}I think they are having lunch now, so no one is here at the moment.{/i}
{i}Wait a minute, they're chatting inside.{/i}
{i}I can't hear what they're talking about.{/i}
{i}But why the hell are they staying here at lunch time?{/i}
{i}Is there something they don't want other people to hear?{/i}
{i}Think about that.{/i}
{i}Suzie was worrying about losing her job.{/i}
{i}But this guy appeared from nowhere, took my position and also took her as his assistant.{/i}
{i}And Suzie seems happy now since her position is safe.{/i}
{i}Anyway, forget about that.{/i}
{i}I'd better go back to my desk before people think I'm a stalker or a peeping loser.{/i}
At 6PM.
{i}I'm still wondering about Suzie and that guy, Woody George.{/i}
{i}Why did he appear so suddenly?{/i}
{i}What does he want from her?{/i}
{i}Ugh... I can't get this out of my mind.{/i}
{i}Should I follow them to know if there are some things fishy?{/i}
{i}Of course not. I'm not a stalking loser. Let's go home.{/i}
{i}I think I should follow them. That's the only way to know if there's something btween them.{/i}
{i}Hm... They haven't gone home yet.{/i}
{i}Everyone went home already.{/i}
{i}There she is.{/i}
{i}I can't hear clearly what they're saying, but I think Suzie is waiting for Woody.{/i}
{i}They're going home together, I think.{/i}
{i}I'll follow them from afar then.{/i}
45 minutes later.
{i}He's only driving her home?{/i}
{i}I thought he would take her to a diner or something.{/i}
{i}I'm not sure what they're saying.{/i}
{i}But it seems that she's thanking him for taking her home.{/i}
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}That's all?{/i}
{i}I think I'm just paranoid after a fucking day at work.{/i}
{i}Let's drive around to relax my mind then.{/i}
{i}I knew it!{/i}
{i}He's chasing the new chick for sure!{/i}
{i}There's no reason for him to follow her home like this.{/i}
6 hours ago.
I don't think that's a problem, Emily.
I'm not so sure about that.
He ignored me and went straight to her seat this morning.
I'm still suspecting what happened when I called him last time.
I think you're just thinking too much.
She was his assistant until this morning, so...
So you think I'm just paranoid?
No, Emily...
Do you know that he hasn't called me or met me since he got home?
I mean...
Okay, I'll investigate this alone.
Wait, Emily...
At present.
{i}I'm just driving around and here I am on the way to Emily's house.{/i}
{i}She inherited this house after her grandmother passed away.{/i}
{i}Wait a minute.{/i}
{i}Why is Alex's car parking there?{/i}
{i}Weird. What's he doing?{/i}
{i}Should I stop the car here and sneak in to see what's going on?{/i}
{i}Let's do that!{/i}
{i}No, I will drive in. There's no reason to be paranoid again!{/i}
{i}That's exactly Alex's car.{/i}
{i}Let's ring the bell.{/i}
I'm sorry to make you sit here, Alex.
The air conditioner in the living room is broken.
I understand, Emily.
We're close friends, don't worry about that.
Ding dong...
Hm? Who's coming here?
I don't have any arrangement today.
Would you please go out to check who's ringing the bell, Alex?
Alright, Emily.
Oh, [povname].
What are you doing here, Alex?
Emily's upset about something.
She asked me to come here.
You're here so I'll go home now.
She's sitting in her bedroom.
Okay, thanks, Alex.
Hi, Emily.
What are you doing here, [povname]?
Er?
Where's Alex?
He's going home.
Please go home, too, [povname].
What?
I'm tired.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
{i}That's exactly Alex's car.{/i}
{i}Her bedroom has a slide door.{/i}
{i}It's facing the back yard.{/i}
{i}I'll sneak in by that door.{/i}
{i}Hm? They're sitting on the bed?{/i}
{i}Why don't they sit in the living room?{/i}
{i}I can't hear what they're talking from here though.{/i}
I'm sorry to make you sit here, Alex.
The air conditioner in the living room is broken.
I understand, Emily.
We're close friends, don't worry about that.
But what's the problem, Emily?
Can you get me some wine in the kitchen?
Why do you want to drink so soon like this?
I'll tell you after I have the drink.
Alright, I'll go.
{i}Should I break up with him?{/i}
Thanks for the drink, Alex.
Now you can tell me what's happening.
[povname] was following Suzie home.
Weird.
Why did he do that?
I don't know.
There's something fishy.
Give me the bottle.
What?
You can't drink too much, you know that.
Just give me.
Okay, it's yours anyway.
He'll regret some days.
I'm regretting that I brought you the drink now.
Not long after that...
Ugh...
{i}She knew she couldn't drink.{/i}
{i}I'll leave then.{/i}
{i}But looking at her like this, I feel so horny.{/i}
{i}Should I touch her?{/i}
{i}I dreamt about this chance for so long.{/i}
{i}Oh my gosh!{/i}
{i}She's unconscious now!{/i}
{i}Will Alex do anything to her?{/i}
{i}Should I step in now?{/i}
{i}No, I think he won't do anything.{/i}
{i}Of course I should step in. Stupid question!{/i}
Hey, Alex!
Er, [povname]?
What are you doing here?
That's my question!
What are you doing with my girlfriend passed out like this?
She's drunk, that's all.
If so, there's nothing to do for you here.
You should go home now.
... Okay.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
{i}What would happen if I didn't step in, Emily?{/i}
{i}Looking at her like this, I'm horny somehow.{/i}
{i}Should I have some fun with her?{/i}
{i}No, let her sleep and go home.{/i}
{i}Why not?{/i}
{i}Remove her trousers, done.{/i}
{i}Remove her panty, done.{/i}
Er, what are you doing?
I'm doing a boyfriend's job, Emily.
I'm going in now.
Wait!
Oh... oh...
Do you feel good, honey?
Um... um...
{i}She doesn't answer.{/i}
{i}What's she thinking?{/i}
{i}Is she thinking that Alex must be the one fucking her now?{/i}
{i}Fuck!{/i}
Ah... ah...
Do you feel good, honey?
{i}Still silent, eh?{/i}
{i}I'll make you scream this time.{/i}
Ah... ah... slow down, [povname]!
Do you feel good?
I said slow down!
No, I can't.
Oh.. oh...
Ah... ah...
You're so tight.
Can I come inside?
Go on, just finish.
Ah... ah...
Ohhhh....
Ah.....
That was pretty good.
Do you feel good, too, honey?
Just go home, please.
Er?
Go home!
Okay, see you tomorrow.
{i}What's he doing?{/i}
{i}Is he trying to take off her trousers?{/i}
{i}Shit! He took her trousers off!{/i}
{i}Emily! Do you know how long I've dreamt about this?{/i}
{i}What the fuck! He took her panty off also!{/i}
{i}You're so beautiful, Emily!{/i}
{i}Oh my gosh!{/i}
{i}He's eating her pussy now!{/i}
{i}Thanks goodness!{/i}
{i}She's awake now.{/i}
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}She's letting him continue?{/i}
{i}What's that?{/i}
{i}He's naked now!{/i}
{i}Are they going to fuck?{/i}
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}Are you letting her cheating on you like that, [povname]?{/i}
{i}She wants that! What can I do now?{/i}
{i}No, I won't let that happen!{/i}
Stop that!
Huh?
What?
{i}What's he doing here?{/i}
{i}When did he come here?{/i}
{i}I couldn't control myself back then!{/i}
{i}Did he see all that?{/i}
{i}How can I explain now?{/i}
{i}But why do I have to explain?{/i}
{i}He's the one cheated on me first!{/i}
{i}I'm breaking up with him anyway!{/i}
Emily, what did...
Save it.
I don't wanna listen to your explanation!
My explanation?
Aren't you the one must explain about what's happening?
What's happening?
You're intruding my home is what's happening!
What?
Go away before I call the police.
What the fuck?
Go!
Are you for real?
Yes, I am!
And you should know about this too: I'm breaking up with you.
We're done!
Okay, fine, fine... I'll go.
Are you happy?
You, too, Alex.
Get out of my house!
Er? Okay.
But let me put my clothes on first.
Quickly!
Okay.
{i}Why hasn't he come out yet?{/i}
{i}Are they fucking inside now?{/i}
[povname], listen, she was drunk and...
I don't wanna listen to your excuse.
Anger's raging inside you.
{i}Hell yeah!{/i}
{i}I'll behave like an adult!{/i}
You're not my friend anymore, Alex!
[povname], I...
Stop that!
This isn't the end, remember!
Fuck you!
Ah!
You're not my friend anymore, Alex!
This isn't the end, remember!
{i}They're fucking for sure!{/i}
{i}Fuck!{/i}
{i}I can't hear clearly.{/i}
{i}But she's having a good fuck for sure!{/i}
{i}Fuck!{/i}
Huff... huff...
{i}His thing is bigger than [povname]'s.{/i}
Oh... ah...
{i}It's stretching me inside...{/i}
{i}He's going faster now!{/i}
{i}Don't tell me he's going to come inside her!{/i}
{i}Shit. He did it.{/i}
{i}Why did she let him do that?{/i}
{i}Why?{/i}
Ah...
{i}I feel it, he's exploding inside me...{/i}
Oh...
This is the best day of my life, Emily!
Umm...
Some hours ago.
Good afternoon, Mr George.
Suzie told me to meet you here before she went out.
Relax, Alex!
Just call me Woody.
I called you in just to ask you one thing: Do you want to have Emily for yourself?
What are you talking about?
Relax.
I know you love Emily and Suzie's just a girl to replace her.
But you surely know no one can replace Emily.
How can you know all that?
Don't worry about that.
I want to offer you a win-win deal now.
Which will let you have Emily and I'll get Suzie since I love her at first sight.
Do we have a deal?
Next morning.
{i}Another day at work.{/i}
{i}What did I do to bring myself into so many troubles like this?{/i}
{i}Is there a way to get out of this situation?{/i}
{i}I don't think Mr Park will promote me again since there's that guy Woody George now.{/i}
{i}Should I find another company to start over?{/i}
{i}Anyway, let's work now.{/i}
{i}I'll consider finding a new job later.{/i}
Before lunch time.
Good afternoon, Mr George.
Ms Lee told me that you wanted to see me.
You know, this Sunday is my birthday.
And I want everyone in our team to gather at my place for a drink.
That's a chance for everyone to know each other better.
But this is just an invitation.
If you're free on that day, you can join us.
And if you decide to join, please send me an email.
I'll reply you with my address.
Yeah, I'll think about that.
Sure. Only if you're free.
And since this is just to drink and to get to know each other better, please don't bring any gift.
Yeah, ok.
Is there anything else, Mr George?
No. You can go now.
Thanks. See you later, Mr George.
See you later.
After lunch.
{i}A birthday party?{/i}
{i}I don't want to go at all.{/i}
{i}But Suzie just told me at lunch that she and Emily would come to his party.{/i}
{i}What will happen if I'm not there?{/i}
{i}I really don't think this guy is a good man.{/i}
6PM.
{i}Hm... Come to his party or not?{/i}
Wondering about coming or not, you got home without even noticing.
{i}Er? When did I get home?{/i}
{i}That's not good.{/i}
{i}I can't keep thinking about this problem.{/i}
{i}I should decide about that right now.{/i}
{i}Let's send him an email to tell him that I'll come.{/i}
{i}No, I won't go.{/i}
Nothing else happens until Saturday night,
You go to sleep after a boring day at home.
Hey, Witter.
Huh? Where am I?
What are you wearing, Emily?
Who's Emily?
Another girl for your harem?
I really can't trust men at all!
What are you talking about, Emily?
I'm not Emily!
{i}Er, it's only a dream?{/i}
{i}But it was so real!{/i}
{i}The girl looks exactly like Emily.{/i}
{i}Only that her skin is darker and her boobs are smaller.{/i}
{i}And what did she wear?{/i}
{i}It's not a modern outfit for sure.{/i}
{i}But I feel like I saw that girl in that outfit already!{/i}
{i}Is it just deja vu?{/i}
{i}Or did I really meet her?{/i}
{i}In a pre-incarnate life?{/i}
{i}Oh, it's just a dream!{/i}
{i}Why bothering myself about that?{/i}
{i}Hmm, in reality, she'll come to Woody's party tonight.{/i}
{i}I wonder what will happen there.{/i}
{i}He also said that he would reply me with the address.{/i}
Nothing else happens until Saturday night,
You go to sleep after a boring day at home.
Hey, Witter.
Huh? Where am I?
What are you wearing, Emily?
Who's Emily?
Another girl for your harem, huh?

{i}Hmm, in reality, she'll come to Woody's party tonight.{/i}
{i}Should I really come?{/i}
{i}Np, I changed my mind.{/i}
{i}I'll go.{/i}
{i}I'll send him a message, telling him that I don’t feel well.{/i}
{i}And I think if I go, I'll get sick for sure.{/i}
That night, at George's place.
Hi, everyone.
Thank you for coming here tonight.
Happy Birthday, Woody!
Happy Birthday!
Thank you, guys.
I asked you here not only to celebrate my birthday.
But also to drink as friends.
This will help us become closer to cooperate better at work.
Do you all have any troubles at work now?
Just say it here.
We'll find solutions together.
No, I'm good.
Nothing's wrong for me, Woody.
Me, too.
If we only do questions and answers, it'll be boring.
Do you guys want to play a game?
That's great!
But what kind of game is it, Woody?
We will ask each other a question.
After that one answers, he or she will ask another one.
Okay, let me ask first.
What is your hobby, Alex?
I usually hang around with my friends at some bars.
Chatting, drinking.
Stuff like that.
Now let me ask Emily.
What is your favorite song recorded in 1960-1970, Emily?
I love Can't Help Falling In Love.
Your turn now, Suzie?
What is your favorite song in 1960-1970s?
It's Yue liang dai biao wo de xin.
What is that?
It's a Chinese song.
Oh, right.
Suzie's from East Asia.
It's not fair if we only ask about Western culture here.
Why don't we ask about East Asia?
That way Suzie won't feel lonely sitting here with us, right Suzie?
I'm fine. Don't worry, Woody.
That's a great idea!
The rule will be the same, right?
No, not like that.
I've studied something about East Asia and it's my birthday, so I want to be the one who asks the questions.
Suzie's from East Asia so she will be the judge.
We will divide into 2 teams: Man and Ladies.
If Alex answers it wrong, he has to drink a full glass.
What about the ladies team?
I think Suzie will decide.
Uh, I don't know.
Then we will punish them when you have the idea.
So, do you guys wanna play?
Sure.
Let's start.
Alex, what does this word mean?
A-O-D-A-I
A-O-D-A-I?
Hm... I think it's a meal.
No, you're wrong.
A-O-D-A-I (Ao Dai) is a traditional dress in Vietnam.
It means Long Dress in English.
Punishment.
Drink, please.
Who is Genghis Khan, Emily?
He was the founder of the Mongol Empire.
Among the architects that built the Forbidden City in Beijing, there was a non-Chinese man.
Which was his home country?
Japan, I think.
You're wrong.
He was Nguyen An, from Vietnam.
Drink, please.
Oliva, which country won over French and American in the 19th century but currently is one of the poorest country in the world?
I think that's Vietnam.
That's right.
Which country won over the Mongol Empire 3 times without becoming its vassal state, Alex?
I think that was Mongolia.
That was Dai Viet, the name of Vietnam at that time.
And Mogol Empire is Mogolia.
Er, I thought Mongolia and the Mongol Empire were different.
Drink, drink!
Do they write the given name before the surname in Chinese, Emily?
No, they write the surname before the given name.
Yeah, and not only Chinese.
Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese... do that also.
Which country in the Mediterranean Sea originated from the land now is a part of China?
I think that is Israel.
No, you're wrong. It's Turkey.
The Turkic people originated from the land which is now the northern part of China.
Hey, I'm starting to get bored.
Could we change this up a little bit?
What do you want to change?
I will replace you to ask the questions and Suzie will replace my place in the ladies team.
Is that okay, Woody?
If Suzie's okay with it.
I'm okay, don't worry.
Some days ago.
What do you want me to do, Woody?
I'll tell you the details later.
But the short version is you just need to tease Suzie and seduce [povname] when the time comes.
Just like the old days, eh?
You know me, haha.
What will I get for that then?
Like the old days too, right?
You know me too, Woody.
Of course, haha.
At present.
Suzie, do you know what a MILF is?
Er? I don't know.
Do you mean MILK?
Yeah, sometimes a MILF can have MILK too.
Stop teasing her, Olivia!
Since you couldn't answer, now tell me one of your secrets, Suzie.
I didn't have time to hang around with friends when I was a student.
So until now, I don't know how to dance.
Like dancing in a club?
Yeah.
Now for Alex.
Tell me two capitals in East Asia have the names mean 'Eastern Capital'.
I don't know about that.
Those are Japan and Vietnam.
Tokyo of Japan means Eastern Capital.
Hanoi of Vietnam was named 'Dong Kinh' in the past, which also meant Eastern Capital.
Okay, now, Emily.
Do you know two countries used Chinese characters in the past but now they don't use anymore?
I don't know.
Are there such countries?
Yes, there are.
Those are Korea and Vietnam.
Now for your punishment.
Take off your top, Emily.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You teased Suzie and now you want me to take my top off?
Are you fucking insane, Olivia?
Come one, Suzie.
Let me take you home.
We shouldn't stay here any longer.
Olivia is trying to make us become sluts like her.
Er, okay, Emily.
Hey, wait. I was just fooling around with you guys.
{i}Shit. The plan failed.{/i}
{i}The garage still hasn't finished fixing my car yet.{/i}
{i}Why do so many bad things happen to me all of a sudden?{/i}
{i}Now I must call a taxi.{/i}
{i}Lucky me, eh?{/i}
Finally, at George's place...
{i}There he is.{/i}
Good evening, Mr George.
Good evening, [povname].
Welcome to my home.
This place is very nice, Mr George.
Thank you.
Give me your coat and come in, please.
Everyone's here already, [povname].
So I'm a just little late?
No, they've all just arrived.
And just call me Woody, please.
Sure thing, Woody.
Everyone is in the living room now.
This way, please.
Okay, Woody.
{i}It looks like an expensive house.{/i}
They're over there.
Please join them.
I'll head back soon.
Okay, Woody.
{i}There they are.{/i}
{i}Even Olivia?{/i}
{i}Why is she here?{/i}
{i}I thought there would be the team members only.{/i}
Hi, everyone.
Oh, hi, [povname].
Sit down and join us, will you?
Sure, Olivia.
{i}I didn't have a chance to talk to Emily these days.{/i}
{i}We were all busy at work.{/i}
Some minutes later.
Hi, everyone.
Thank you for coming here tonight.
Happy Birthday, Woody!
Happy Birthday!
Thank you, guys.
I asked you here not only to celebrate my birthday.
But also to drink as friends.
This will help us become closer to cooperate better at work.
{i}Olivia is Mr Park's secretary.{/i}
{i}When did she become a part of this team and would cooperate anything with us?{/i}
Do you all have any troubles at work now?
Just say it here.
We'll find solutions together.
No, I'm good.
Nothing's wrong for me, Woody.
Me, too.
How about you, [povname]?
Nothing's wrong for me.
{i}Except that you stole my position and my assistant.{/i}
If we only do questions and answers, it'll be boring.
Do you guys want to play a game?
That's great!
But what kind of game is it, Woody?
We will ask each other a question.
After that one answers, he or she will ask another one.
Okay, let me ask first.
What is your hobby, Alex?
I usually hang around with my friends at some bars.
Chatting, drinking.
Stuff like that.
Now let me ask Emily.
What is your favorite song recorded in 1960-1970, Emily?
I love Can't Help Falling In Love.
Your turn now, Suzie?
What is your favorite song in 1960-1970s?
It's Yue liang dai biao wo de xin.
What is that?
It's a Chinese song.
Oh, right.
Suzie's from East Asia.
It's not fair if we only ask about Western culture here.
Why don't we ask about East Asia?
That way Suzie won't feel lonely sitting here with us, right Suzie?
I'm fine. Don't worry, Woody.
That's a great idea!
The rule will be the same, right?
No, not like that.
I've studied something about East Asia and it's my birthday, so I want to be the one who asks the questions.
Suzie's from East Asia so she will be the judge.
We will divide into 2 teams: Men and Ladies.
If one of the men answers it wrong, each of them has to drink a full glass.
What about the ladies team?
I think Suzie will decide.
Uh, I don't know.
Then we will punish them when you have the idea.
{i}Huh?{/i}
{i}I think he's trying to make the ladies like him.{/i}
So, do you guys wanna play?
Sure.
Let's start.
Alex, what does this word mean?
A-O-D-A-I
A-O-D-A-I?
Hm... I think it's a meal.
No, you're wrong.
A-O-D-A-I (Ao Dai) is a traditional dress in Vietnam.
It means Long Dress in English.
Punishment.
Drink, please.
{i}What am I getting myself into here?{/i}
Gulp.
Who is Genghis Khan, Emily?
{i}An easy question, asshole!{/i}
He was the founder of the Mongol Empire.
{i}Who paid attention in class could know that easily.{/i}
Among the architects that built the Forbidden City in Beijing, there was a non-Chinese man.
Which was his home country?
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}Why is my question the hardest?{/i}
{i}What is the answer?{/i}
A Korean man.
A Japanese man.
A Vietnamese man.
An American man.
You're wrong.
He was Nguyen An, from Vietnam.
{i}Shit.{/i}
Drink, please.
Gulp.
You're right.
He was Nguyen An, from Vietnam.
Oliva, which country won over French and American in the 19th century but currently is one of the poorest country in the world?
{i}Another easy question.{/i}
I think that's Vietnam.
That's right.
Which country won over the Mongol Empire 3 times without becoming its vassal state, Alex?
I think that was Mongolia.
Are you for real, Alex?
Mongolia won over the Mongol Empire?
That was Dai Viet, the name of Vietnam at that time.
Did you hear that, Alex?
Er, I thought Mongolia and the Mongol Empire were different.
Drink, drink!
{i}There's something wrong here.{/i}
{i}I think he's just playing dumb!{/i}
Gulp.
Do they write the given name before the surname in Chinese, Emily?
{i}He asked me hard questions but asked them easy questions on purpose.{/i}
No, they write the surname before the given name.
Yeah, and not only Chinese.
Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese... do that also.
Which country in the Mediterranean Sea originated from the land now is a part of China?
I think that's an easy question.
Don't be so sarcastic.
You're the best here so the question isn't easy like others.
{i}Which country?{/i}
Turkey.
Cyprus.
Malta.
Albania.
No, you're wrong. It's Turkey.
The Turkic people originated from the land which is now the northern part of China.
{i}Shit.{/i}
{i}I'm starting to feel dizzy.{/i}
That's right.
The Turkic people originated from the land which is now the northern part of China.
Hey, I'm starting to get bored.
Could we change this up a little bit?
What do you want to change?
I will replace you to ask the questions and Suzie will replace my place in the ladies team.
Is that okay, Woody?
If Suzie's okay with it.
I'm okay, don't worry.
Some days ago.
What do you want me to do, Woody?
I'll tell you the details later.
But the short version is you just need to tease Suzie and seduce [povname] when the time comes.
Just like the old days, eh?
You know me, haha.
What will I get for that then?
Like the old days too, right?
You know me too, Woody.
Of course, haha.
At present.
Suzie, do you know what a MILF is?
Er? I don't know.
Do you mean MILK?
Yeah, sometimes a MILF can have MILK too.
Stop teasing her, Olivia!
Since you couldn't answer, now tell me one of your secrets, Suzie.
I didn't have time to hang around with friends when I was a student.
So until now, I don't know how to dance.
Like dancing in a club?
Yeah.
Now for the men's team.
[povname], tell me two capitals in East Asia have the names mean 'Eastern Capital'.
Why do I always get easy questions, eh?
Drink if you can't answer.
{i}Shit.{/i}
{i}Which countries?{/i}
Japan and China.
China and Korea.
Korea and Japan.
Japan and Vietnam.
Those are Japan and Vietnam.
Tokyo of Japan means Eastern Capital.
Hanoi of Vietnam was named 'Dong Kinh' in the past, which also meant Eastern Capital.
{i}Shit.{/i}
Gulp.
You're right.
Those are Japan and Vietnam.
Tokyo of Japan means Eastern Capital.
Hanoi of Vietnam was named 'Dong Kinh' in the past, which also meant Eastern Capital.
You passed out.
When you open your eyes.
Come one, Suzie.
Let me take you home.
We shouldn't stay here any longer.
Olivia is trying to make us become sluts like her.
Er, okay, Emily.
Hey, wait. I was just fooling around with you guys.
{i}Shit. The plan failed.{/i}
{i}What is it?{/i}
{i}Olivia?{/i}
You passed out again.
{i}What the hell are you doing, Emily?{/i}
Okay, now, Emily.
Do you know two countries used Chinese characters in the past but now they don't use anymore?
I don't know.
Are there such countries?
Yes, there are.
Those are Korea and Vietnam.
Now for your punishment.
Take off your top, Emily.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You teased Suzie and now you want me to take my top off?
Are you fucking insane, Olivia?
Come one, Suzie.
Let me take you home.
We shouldn't stay here any longer.
Olivia is trying to make us become sluts like her.
Er, okay, Emily.
Hey, wait. I was just fooling around with you guys.
{i}Shit. The plan failed.{/i}
{i}[povname] is looking at me right now.{/i}
{i}How can I behave like a slut before his eyes?{/i}
{i}Wait a minute.{/i}
{i}We broke up!{/i}
{i}He's the one cheated on me first.{/i}
{i}Why do I care about what he thinks about me?{/i}
{i}I'm a free woman.{/i}
{i}I can do whatever I want.{/i}
Satisfied, Olivia?
Oh my gosh, stop that, Emily!
Hell yeah!
I didn't think you would do that.
Why not?
I can do anything I want!
Bet that you won't dare let Alex touch your boobies.
Stop that, Olivia!
Yes, I dare!
Emily!
Are you sure, Emily?
I've never been so sure like this before!
What the fuck?
What are you guys doing?
Umm...
I had enough of this!
Fuck you, Alex!
Olivia, where are you?
What the fuck were you thinking?
Are you looking for me, dear?
What are you doing now, Olivia?
Trying to meet my little friend here.
{i}Is she trying to take off my trousers?{/i}
{i}Fuck life. Let's do it!{/i}
{i}I'd better stop her now!{/i}
Enough already, Olivia!
Eww. He couldn't get a boner so he denied me.
It's not like that!
Whatever.
You guys are so obscene.
I'm out of here.
I'll never join you guys again!
Wait, Suzie.
I'm going with you.
After some minutes, you and Suzie got into a taxi.
At first, she wanted to go alone.
But after you said that her house was also on your way home, she accepted to come home together.
Suzie seems a little bit down.
She thought Alex was a decent guy when she first met him.
He helped her with all he could when she was only an intern.
Although she thought it was a bit fast for the next step, she still accepted to become his girlfriend.
But tonight, Alex did what she hated the most.
She really hates how people can easily have sex at a party when they're drunk.
But wait, was he drunk?
She doesn't think so.
Why do you keep looking at me?
Oh, nothing.
I'm worried about you, Suzie.
At Suzie's home.
Thank you for taking me home.
Good night, [povname].
Good night.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
If you need something, just tell me.
Sure, [povname].
At Suzie's home.
Thank you for taking me home.
Good night, [povname].
Good night.
Before you could turn back to the taxi, Suzie leans forward and gives you a peck on your cheek.
Um. I'd better come inside now.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
See you.
{i}But what about them?{/i}
Ooh.
Look who's horny already.
Are you ready, dear?
You guys are so obscene.
I'm out of here.
I'll never join you guys again!
{i}Part one of the plan was a success.{/i}
{i}Now part two.{/i}
{i}What the fuck is he standing behind Emily for?{/i}
Do you feel good, [povname]?
Er?
Hey!
Let me give you a memorable night.
Hey, wait.
I'm not ready!
But I'm ready.
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
Ohhh.....
Hey, Woody!
That's not a part of the deal!
{i}Fuck my life!{/i}
Oh... oh... oh...
What's the deal?
I've never signed anything with you.
{i}His cock is so long and thick.{/i}
{i}It's stretching my pussy...{/i}
Um... um... um...
Woody George keeps on having his way with Emily.
Who is being humiliated here?
[povname], who is looking at his ex-girlfriend moaning with a dick not his?
Or is it Alex? Who thought he could have a chance with Emily but he lost not only Suzie but also Emily?
Do you want me to come inside?
Huff... no... huff... please don't... huff...
Not this time then.
There's someone waiting for you here. Haha.
You think I'll touch her again?
Forget about that!
Fuck you, Woody!
Oh...
Who said that I would let you touch any girl under my watch, [povname]?
What?
You can have her, Alex.
But for this time only.
She's not yours, asshole!
Oh, really?
Not only Emily, Suzie'll soon be mine.
I'll never let that happen!
We'll see.
Ohhh...
Oh, there he comes.
Tomorrow morning.
When you arrive at the company, you see Emily is also on her way to the office.
Hmm.
Hmm.
What's the problem, babe?
Last week, I saw you followed Suzie and Woody all the way to her home.
But I was too busy to ask you what the hell was happening.
Last night, when I was taking her home, I suddenly remembered that incident.
So what the fuck was that, [povname]?
It wasn't like that.
So what the fuck?
We met Mr George on our trip.
I thought he targeted her.
And when he suddenly appeared to replace my position, I was a little bit paranoid and followed them.
I followed them because I wanted to make sure he didn't do anything wrong.
Don't you know that was a hard time for me after I was demoted?
You think I'll believe that?
What?
Goodbye, [povname].
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm breaking up with you!
Hey, wait.
No, don't touch me.
Farewell.
What the...
You're so paranoid.
I'm not your father.
I'm tired of explaining all the time.
So now I'm just paranoid, eh?
Yeah!
Goodbye, [povname].
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm breaking up with you!
Hey, wait!
No, don't touch me!
Farewell.
What the...
Hmm.
What's the problem, babe?
Last week, I saw you followed Suzie and Woody all the way to her home.
But I was too busy to ask you what the hell was happening.
Last night, when I was taking her home, I suddenly remembered that incident.
So what the fuck was that, [povname]?
It wasn't like that.
So what the fuck?
We met Mr George on our trip.
I thought he targeted her.
And when he suddenly appeared to replace my position, I was a little bit paranoid and followed them.
I followed them because I wanted to make sure he didn't do anything wrong.
Don't you know that was a hard time for me after I was demoted?
I didn't think about that.
I only thought that you was following Suzie because you wanted to take her from Alex just like before.
It was the past, Emily.
I know what I did wasn't good.
But because I loved you.
All's fair in love and war.
Um... Sorry.
That's okay. I'm sorry I didn't tell you anything about Mr George and Suzie.
Okay, [povname].
Now let's go to the office.
And don't think too much.
I love you, babe.
Okay.
You're so paranoid.
I'm not your father.
I'm tired of explaining all the time.
So now I'm just paranoid, eh?
Yeah!
Goodbye, [povname].
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm breaking up with you!
Hey, wait!
No, don't touch me!
Farewell.
What the...
Hey, babe. You've just arrived?
Yeah.
Last night was terrible.
Let's go to the office, babe.
Okay, honey.
Everything seems to be normal in the morning.
But right after the lunch time...
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}What's that asshole doing here?{/i}
Hi, Olivia.
Hi, [povname].
Do you know what's that bald guy doing here for?
Oh, I thought you knew it?
Me? No, I don't know.
He came here to sign a contract.
What?
I thought he turned it down no matter what we did?
I'm not sure.
Why don't you ask Woody or Mr Park?
Um, okay.
Thank you, Oliva.
You're welcome, [povname].
Mr Brie, please wait for some minutes.
After I finish it, you could check again to make sure everything's fine.
But I'd like to check it now, hehe.
Er?
Stop!
Please behave yourself!
I'm just joking, dear.
But I'm not joking, Mr Brie!
I'll call the cops if you touch me again.
Relax, Ms Lee.
Do you want the cops to watch the clip, too?
What?
My house happened to have surveillance cameras, you know?
And I inattentive recorded that incident in a USB drive.
Oh my gosh!
Worried that he could upload the clip, Suzie asks him to give her the USB drive and delete all other records of the incident.
Mr Brie accepts.
But he doesn't bring it along so he wants her to come to his hotel room to get the USB.
{i}What should I do now?{/i}
{i}I feel so trapped.{/i}
{i}I think he won't let me go that easily.{/i}
{i}And how will I know if he really will delete all other records or not?{/i}
{i}What should I do now?{/i}
{i}If I have someone who can help me...{/i}
{i}Speak about someone... [povname] is the only one knows about that day.{/i}
{i}I avoided him until now.{/i}
{i}But maybe he can help me this time...{/i}
Half an hour later...
Why do you want to meet me here, Suzie?
That guy, Jim Brie, came here today, [povname].
Yeah, I know.
He comes here to sign the contract.
Congratulation, Suzie.
After this first deal, you'll make more bigger deals for sure.
But it has nothing to do with the fact that you called me here, right?
{i}She seems a little bit worried.{/i}
He recorded everything the day we came to his house.
What? That scumbag did that?
And I have to come to his hotel room tonight if I want to get back the USB drive.
Fucking asshole!
What do I do now, [povname]? Should I go?
Yeah, you should go.
I'll go with you.
You think so?
Yes, I think so.
You should get it back before he uploads it.
Hm... If you say so...
Suzie gets back to her desk, still thinking if she should go or not.
{i}[povname] didn't give me an advice.{/i}
{i}Should I really come to his place?{/i}
{i}I know I can only get it back if I let him... me again.{/i}
{i}What will happen if Alex finds out?{/i}
{i}He knew that I was still a virgin when I started to date him.{/i}
{i}Oh, wait a minute.{/i}
{i}Alex was a jerk last night too.{/i}
{i}I don't want to date him anymore.{/i}
{i}Once or twice, it won't change the fact that I'm not a virgin anymore...{/i}
After work, at Jim Brie's hotel room.
I knew you would come.
Come in, please.
Sit down, please.
Do you want to have a drink?
No, thanks.
I don't wanna bother you.
Please give me the USB drive and I'll go immediately.
But first you must help me with something.
What do you want me to do?
This.
He's saying while he's unzipping his pants.
Before Suzie's eyes is the thing that defiled her not long ago.
What?
Just start jerking it.
{i}I knew it would come to this.{/i}
{i}But I think it's better with just my hand like this.{/i}
Is this okay?
Yes, just like that.
Your hand is so soft.
You were still a virgin back then, right?
I'm pretty sure your boyfriend is lucky.
He must let you massage his cock like this everyday for sure. Haha.
No! I've never done this before!
What? I'm the first man again?
Shit! What you just said is too much!
That's it! Keep going!
I'm gonna come soon!
I'm coming now...
Aahh.....
{i}At least it's done now.{/i}
{i}I'll get the USB drive and come home immediately.{/i}
Er?
Hehe.
What are you doing?
You agreed to help me satisfy my cock.
But look at it now.
Does it look satisfied?
But...
Delicious.
No, Mr Brie!
Just let it go, Ms Lee.
Ohhh...
{i}I can't back down now, just let him do what he wants and I can get the USB drive...{/i}
Are you ready, my dear?
Are you sure you'll give me the USB drive this time?
Of course, Ms Lee. Hehe.
Oohh...
You're so fucking tight, just like the last time!
Um... um...
Didn't you let anyone fuck you after me?
Um... um... no..
Then why don't you become my woman, girl?
No!... um... um...
Oh, you're so tight...
Huff... huff...
I can't hold it anymore...
Huff... please... take... huff... it out...
Ah... you're so tight...
Please....
Ah...
Um...
{i}Something is... releasing inside me...{/i}
{i}Is this what they call an orgasm?{/i}
You didn't pull it out?
You didn't realize that?
I guess you were busy with your cumming, right?
I... No, it's not like that!
Don't deny it, girl.
You had your orgasm.
That's why you didn't know I came inside you.
No...
She says no.
But deep down inside, she knows he's right about that.
Thanks, [povname].
That's okay, Suzie.
We'll get back the USB drive, don't worry.
Yeah, thank you.
After work, at Jim Brie's hotel room.
I knew you would come.
What the fuck are you doing here?
He's coming with me.
Despite feeling annoyed, Jim Brie still leads the way into his room.
So tell me, what do you want?
I didn't invite you here.
I just want to get the USB drive.
Hahaha...
You're so funny.
So you think I'll give you the USB drive for free just by asking?
Hahaha...
Oh, where's my manner?
Let me bring you some drink first.
Would you like some cocktail?
Oh, wait. Milk is better for funny kids like you.
Hahaha...
Feeling enraged, you really want to hit the bastard.
{i}Why not?{/i}
{i}No, I will trick him.{/i}
You take out your phone and start to record your conversation with Jim Brie in quietness.
What do you want?
Suzie's body again?
Of course. Hahaha.
What do you think then?
Your body? Hahaha.
So you mean, if she agrees to have sex with you here, you'll give her the USB drive recorded her previous sexual intercourse with you?
Exactly!
If not, what will you do?
Why are you asking so many questions?
And why are you holding your phone?
That's enough.
Let's leave, Suzie.
Hey, what the fuck?
After getting out of his room, you start to persuade Suzie.
Listen to me, the incident at his house was a mistake.
But now, you only have one choice, report it to the police.
But if anyone knows about this, my life will be ruined.
And who will believe me?
Don't worry, I recorded the conversation.
We also will ask them to keep you anonymous.
No one will know about this.
But...
Let's go, Suzie!
Uhm...
But please don't tell anyone!
Sure, let's go.
Later, some policemen arrive at Jim Brie's hotel room.
Good evening?
Good evening, are you Mr Brie?
Yeah. What can I do for you, officers?
We've got a report with evidences against you.
Please cooperate and come with us.
What?
Some months later.
You've got what you deserve, eh, baldie?
Is that okay?
I don't want any troubles.
I'm going to be released soon.
Don't worry.
I'll take the blame myself.
But I'm pretty sure they won't punish me for this.
Who the hell will protect someone like him?
What do think if your girl meets him?
Yeah, you're right.
He'll be another Garen Asfuq here.
Back to the current time.
You step forward to hit him.
Ahh...
No, [povname]!
Hey, hey, calm down!
Fuck you, asshole!
Give me the USB drive or not?
Alright, alright.
Just get it and leave.
Right after getting the USB drive, you and Suzie gets out of his room.
{i}Why did he let us go so easily like this?{/i}
{i}Maybe he still keeps the clip somewhere else.{/i}
{i}If so, I'll beat the shit out of him again!{/i}
When you were still thinking, Suzie starts to speak in a worried voice.
I'm worried, [povname].
Why?
We've got the USB drive now.
But...
Don't worry.
If he does anything else, I'll beat him again.
Now let me take you home.
Uhm... Okay.
That night.
Hi, honey.
Yeah, we will stay at my mom's for another week.
Okay, see you soon. Love you.
What's wrong, honey?
Why did you lie to daddy?
Are we not going home now?
I wanna make a surprise for him.
Today is dad and mom's anniversary.
What's an anniversary?
You'll understand when you grow up, honey.
Um...
Whose heels are those, mommy?
Honey, wait for me here, okay?
Okay.
Mrs Rothman tried not to make a sound.
But when she got closer to her bedroom, she heard a familiar voice.
And that was a surprise for her...
Huff... hufff...
Am I better than your wife?
Oh... oh...
When will you leave my cousin?
Ah...
I'm waiting for so long now...
Ah...
Mommy...
Honey, stay here with granny, okay?
Why did we go back to granny's place, mommy?
Just for a little while.
Why are you crying?
Listen, I'll come back.
Just wait for me here, okay?
Okay, I'll wait for you here.
But you must promise that you'll come back soon.
I promise.
Mommy...
Emily, come inside, honey.
It'll be dark soon.
But I'm waiting for mommy!
Poor baby.
Your mother won't come back... soon.
Just go inside, honey.
But mommy promised!
Oh, honey...
Mommy will come back.
She promised!
Mommy!
Oh, mommy...
Next morning.
Hm?
Emily's off today?
At that time, Emily's sitting with Dr Alphonso Areola in his office.
So, she hasn't come back, has she?
No, she hasn't.
But when I'm under so much stress, I always dream about that time.
Hm...
Do you have any suggestion for me, Doctor?
I think you should try some hypnotherapy.
Hmm...
Okay, Doctor.
Please arrange a schedule for me.
After lunch, when you're on the way back to your desk...
Good afternoon.
Are you Mr [povname], sir?
Yes, I am.
How can I help you, officers?
We've got a report from Mr Brie that you attacked him last night.
His phone accidently recorded the incident because he forgot to turn the recording mode off.
Oh my gosh.
Accidently my ass.
Confused and worried, Suzie gets back to her desk, thinking...
{i}Because of me, now [povname] is in trouble.{/i}
{i}It's all my fault.{/i}
{i}How can I face his family if something happens to him?{/i}
{i}I can't let that happen.{/i}
{i}I think I know how to solve this...{/i}
Suzie decides to come to Mr Brie's place again that night.
Good evening, Ms Lee.
Good evening, Mr Brie.
Come in, please.
So, what can I do for you tonight, Ms Lee?
I think you know why I'm here.
Why?
I don't know.
Please drop your charge against [povname].
Why must I do that?
What can I do for you?
Become my woman.
You mean becoming your wife?
Silly girl.
Why should I marry anyone?
Just become my woman.
Hm...
Alright.
Now take off your clothes and lie down on the bed.
Suzie turns around to take off her clothes.
No, don't be like that.
Show me your face and your body.
Okay, wait for me.
Hahaha.
As Jim Brie stands above her...
Still don't wanna look at me, do you?
Now move your hands.
Let me see your tits.
Still keeping silent, Suzie moves her hands.
Hm...
So silent today.
Now, move your thighs.
Suzie just lies there, letting him do anything he wants.
Um...
She gives a soft moan when he starts to lick her pussy.
After seeing that her pussy starts to get wet, he stands up.
Now, give me your head.
Doesn't say anything, she turns away her head.
Deny?
Hm... Alright.
Waiting no more, Jim Brie enters Suzie.
Um...
Huff... huff...
How do you feel, Suzie?
Huff... huff...
Hm... still silent.
Huff... huff...
You will say kimochi in your language, right?
I... huff... am not... huff... Japanese...
Where are you from?
Um... Jiangsu...
What?
Is that a country?
Oh... I can't hold it anymore...
Um...
Oh...
So good... oh...
How do you feel?
Hm... You'll talk soon.
Some days later,
When you're about to go home,
You see Suzie and Woody are discussing outside their office.
{i}On second thought, I'd better go home.{/i}
{i}Let's see what's going on.{/i}
At my party, you said that you had never danced before, right?
Yeah, I said so.
Hm... Sometimes you need to dance with customers at a party.
If you deny them all the time, that won't be good for your career at all.
Care to join me tonight?
I can show you how to dance.
{i}Shit! The ugly guy is trying to seduce her!{/i}
{i}Well, she's not mine and that's not my problem.{/i}
{i}I'd better stop him.{/i}
Er, I'm sorry that I overheard.
But I had an appointment with her tonight.
Right, Suzie?
Er, I'm pretty sure that I don't have any appointment.
I'll go with Mr George tonight.
{i}Shit.{/i}
{i}Haha.{/i}
Um... Sorry, Mr George.
I have an appointment with [povname].
Well, maybe next time then.
{i}Remember me, [povname], you asshole!{/i}
Thank you for helping me, [povname].
{i}No, I'm not interested in her.{/i}
{i}Of course.{/i}
Hey, how about going out with me tonight?
Er, I'm sorry.
I... have another appointment.
Oh, okay.
You're welcome, Suzie.
That evening.
You're so beautiful tonight.
Thank you, Mr George.
Call me Woody.
Now, get in.
Okay, Woody.
At the bar.
So, tell me, Suzie.
Where are you from?
I'm from Wuxi, a city in Jiangsu.
China?
Yeah.
Why did you come here?
I think China has many opportunities for young people nowadays, right?
But the environment is polluted.
I also came here to find a better life for my future children.
I see.
Oh, enough chatting.
Let's practice dancing, shall we?
Okay.
Er, Woody.
I actually don't know anything about dancing.
Just hold me, let me show you.
Yeah, like this...
Easy, easy.
{i}Shit, she's so soft.{/i}
{i}Her scent is also so good.{/i}
{i}I'm starting to get a boner.{/i}
{i}I wish I could just grab her ass right now.{/i}
{i}But that's not a good choice at this stage.{/i}
Er, please stop.
I don't wanna dance anymore.
Why?
Just... take me home, please.
Hm... Okay, if that's what you want.
Thank you for tonight, Woody.
Woody gives a gentle smile.
Actually, I didn't show you how to dance at all.
But don't worry about that.
We still have next time.
I'm sorry.
Hey, don't worry.
That's okay.
Um... do you... want to come in?
Can I?
Of course I do.
This is the first time a colleague visits my room.
Inside her room.
I live here with 2 friends.
They're at a party now.
They didn't let you go with them?
Um... no.
I don't like those activities much.
As Suzie sits before Woody, she suddenly becomes silent.
It becomes a little awkward.
{i}Shit, she becomes so silent.{/i}
So, have you been living here since the time you came to this city?
I lived in the campus dorm.
But later, I moved out with some friends.
How about you?
How long have you been here?
I've moved here around 10 years ago.
I'm sorry that I asked you to come home so early.
{i}Again?{/i}
Hey, don't worry.
It's just that I've never been so close to a man like that before.
What?
You haven't hugged any guy before?
My mom taught me not to.
Hey, that's normal here.
Friends can hug each other normally.
But...
Oh, I forgot.
I'll get you some water.
Sorry, but we're not allowed to drink here.
That's okay. Please don't worry.
Suddenly, Suzie slips.
Woody doesn't hesitate to hold her...
With his left hand on her boob.
And his right hand on her butt.
Er, Woody, thanks but your hands...
Could you let me go now?
{i}Shit, I can't restrain myself anymore!{/i}
Um...
But Suzie pushes him away.
Er, please stop.
My friends will be home soon.
I'm sorry, Suzie.
Just leave, please.
{i}Shit. I ruined everything in the end!{/i}
{i}But I'm too horny now!{/i}
{i}Let's call Olivia.{/i}
An hour later.
There he is.
Why did you call me so late tonight, Woody?
Doesn't say anything, Woody just pushes her against the wall,
Hey, I've just got here.
And pulls down her jeans.
Oh... oh...
{i}Shit, I want to fuck Suzie.{/i}
Why are you so rough today... ah...
{i}Fuck!{/i}
But I like it... oh... oh...
Woody doesn't care about Olivia, there's only Suzie in his head right now.
{i}Oh... Suzie...{/i}
Um... um...
{i}Ah... Suzie...{/i}
Um... um...
Slow down... please...
Um... um...
Fuck!
Receive my seeds!
Ummm...
Oh...
If I get pregnant, you'll have to marry me, Woody.
Shit!
{i}Fuck! I forgot that I was fucking her not Suzie!{/i}
I'd like to.
But... I don't have a car.
They finished repairing my car.
I can pick you up tonight.
Really?
That's great!
That evening.
You're so... beautiful tonight.
Thank you, [povname].
Hop in, please.
Yeah.
At the bar.
So, tell me, Suzie.
Where are you from?
I'm from Wuxi, a city in Jiangsu.
It's China?
Yeah.
Why did you come here, Suzie?
Just to study or you want to stay back?
Yeah, I want to stay back after studying.
My children will have better education when they grow up.
I see.
Oh, would you like to dance?
I don't know how to dance.
Let me show you.
Um... okay.
How should I do now, [povname]?
Just hold me, I'll show you how to dance.
Yeah, like this...
Easy, easy.
{i}Hm, she's so soft.{/i}
{i}Her scent is so good.{/i}
{i}I'm starting to get a boner.{/i}
{i}I want to touch her now.{/i}
{i}Should I touch her and pretend that my hand slips?{/i}
{i}Do it, stupid question!{/i}
{i}No, no, that's not good at all!{/i}
Oh?
Er, please stop.
I don't wanna dance anymore.
Why?
Just... take me home, please.
Okay, let's go, Suzie.
Thank you for tonight, [povname].
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you for tonight, [povname].
But I'm sorry that I asked you to come home so early.
Hey, don't worry.
Good night, Suzie.
Hey, wait.
Do you want to come in?
Oh, can I?
Of course.
This is the first time a colleague visits my room.
Inside her room.
I live here with 2 friends.
They're at a party now.
They didn't let you go with them?
Um... no.
I don't like those activities much.
As Suzie sits before you, she suddenly becomes silent.
It becomes a little awkward.
So, have you been living here since the time you came to this city?
I lived in the campus dorm.
But later, I moved out with some friends.
How about you?
How long have you been here?
I was born and raised in this city.
I'm sorry for pushing you.
Hey, don't worry.
It's just that I'm still not used to be so close to a man like that.
Oh, I see.
My mom taught me not to let people think of me as an easy girl.
Don't think too much, Suzie.
Just take it easy.
But...
Oh, I forgot.
I'll get you some water.
Sorry, but we're not allowed to drink here.
You don't need to, Suzie.
Suddenly, Suzie slips.
But before she fells down,
Got cha!
Thank you, [povname].
Could you let me go now?
{i}Hm... She's so cute.{/i}
Yes, I do!
No, this is her place! I should behave myself!
But when you start to lower your face.
No!
I forgot that my friends will be home soon.
Yeah... It's... also late now.
I think I should go home.
Yeah.
Who was that, Suzie?
Just my colleague, Ms Beaumont.
Please remember that I don't allow any dirty things here, Suzie.
If you want, please come to his place.
We didn't do anything, Ms Beaumont.
Later, when everyone's fast asleep, Suzie's still awake.
It looks like something inside her has been triggered.
She feels a little bit regret that she had to send him home because she was scared of Ms Beaumont.
Dianne Beaumont is kind but very strict.
She allows female students from other countries to stay at her home with a cheap price.
Even after they graduated, they could still stay back until there are other students need to rent the room.
In exchange, they aren't allowed to throw a party or to have sex in her house.
When guys visit the girls, she'll have a closer look at them.
But right now, Suzie doesn't think about that.
She only thinks about what would happen if she wasn't scared of Ms Beaumont.
{i}If I didn't make him leave, will he continue?{/i}
{i}Will he be gentle or rough?{/i}
{i}People say that men aren't gentle on the bed anymore.{/i}
{i}They become very different.{/i}
{i}They become beasts.{/i}
{i}But will he make me feel good though?{/i}
{i}Or will he just have his way without any hesitation?{/i}
{i}Oh... My vagina is wet...{/i}
{i}Is this love juice?{/i}
{i}Will my vagina be this wet when he... does me?{/i}
{i}Will it be hurt?{/i}
{i}People say that it'll be hurt the first time.{/i}
{i}Oh... it feels... good.{/i}
{i}Is this how people masturbate?{/i}
Suddenly, she hears her friend snores.
{i}Oh my gosh!{/i}
{i}I forgot that I'm not here alone.{/i}
{i}I'd better sleep before I could wake them up.{/i}
Somewhere in South America...
Yeah, I'll be home in 2 or 3 days more.
Oh...
No, nothing.
No one's here.
A mosquito just bit me.
There are too many mosquitoes here.
I'm hanging up now.
Bye, honey.
Stop, I want it now.
Oh...
Yeah...
Keep going...
Ah...
At the clinic of Doctor Alphonso Areola the following day.
Are you ready for the therapy, Ms Rothman?
Yes, I am, Doctor.
Good. Now please move to the next room.
Please close your eyes.
And remove all your thoughts.
There's nothing inside your head now.
It's only darkness.
Nothing to worry.
Nothing to be troubled.
You feel like...
Er, where am I?
I'm just waiting for the day that I'm strong enough.
What are you talking about, Suzie?
And what are you wearing?
It's the traditional outfit of your country?
It's... weird.
What are you talking about, Myra?
Myra? Who's Myra?
And the light comes back into your head slowly...
Hey, wait!
I'm not done asking her!
Hey!
What the...
It's dark again.
How was that, Ms Rothman?
That was short and weird.
Short?
The therapy was around 30 minutes.
30 minutes?
It's like 30 seconds for me.
You could check the time.
I let you sleep peacefully, to erase your mind from your childhood trauma.
Well, yeah.
Now I have another unknown memory.
What memory?
Well, nevermind.
See you in the next therapy.
Hm... Okay. See you.
At 6PM, when you are about to go home, you see Suzie and Woody are standing outside of their office again.
I want to watch Erodio.
My friend watched it yesterday and she said it was very good.
{i}Hm... It seems that they're going to watch a movie tonight.{/i}
{i}Well, it's none of my business though.{/i}
{i}I should just go home.{/i}
That night, at the movie theater.
Our seats are over there.
It seems that there aren't many people watching this movie tonight.
Yeah. Erodio's been shown for 3 weeks already.
A little bit shy, Suzie tries not to sit too close to Woody.
Some minutes later, when they're watching Erodio.
Wow! That fairy looks a lot like you, Suzie.
Really?
Oh yeah.
A little bit, I think.
So, tell me, Suzie.
Are you an eastern fairy like her?
Stop teasing me!
She knows that he's just flattering her.
But somehow she's happy to hear that.
{i}Still shy, eh?{/i}
Oh no!
What?
Don't look!
Why?
She's bathing.
But why?
We're watching the movie, aren't we?
But she's... naked.
It's not a big deal to watch a naked woman in a movie, Suzie.
But she looks like me, so...
Ah, I understand.
So if she doesn't look like you, I could watch her naked body, right?
No, it's not like that.
{i}She's so cute.{/i}
{i}I really want to kiss her.{/i}
{i}But what if she pushes me again this time?{/i}
{i}Hm... Now or never.{/i}
{i}Just try my luck!{/i}
No! Woody, um...
Um...
{i}Good, she accepts my kiss.{/i}
{i}It's time for more now!{/i}
{i}Her thigh is so soft.{/i}
No, Woody!
{i}Shit, she stops me again!{/i}
Oh, I'm sorry.
{i}Maybe that's too fast for her.{/i}
How could you do that in the public?
I'm sorry, Suzie.
{i}Who the fuck could see us in this dark movie theater?{/i}
I'm sorry.
But I'll catch a taxi to go home now.
Bye.
Hey!
{i}What the fuck?{/i}
{i}Hm? Suzie sent me an email?{/i}
{i}What does she want?{/i}
Hi, [povname].
Are you free tonight?
My friend said Erodio was great.
I want to watch that movie.
I wonder if you want to join me.
Nice day.
See you.
{i}Hm... She wants to watch a movie.{/i}
{i}Should I go with her?{/i}
{i}I should tell her that I'll pick her up tonight.{/i}
{i}I should tell her that I'm busy tonight.{/i}
That night, at the movie theater.
Our seats are over there.
It seems that there aren't many people watching this movie tonight.
Yeah. Erodio's been shown for 3 weeks already.
A little bit shy, Suzie tries not to sit too close to you.
Some minutes later, when you are watching Erodio.
Wow! That fairy looks a lot like you, Suzie.
Really?
Oh yeah.
A little bit, I think.
But she's not as cute as you.
Stop teasing me!
She knows that you're just flattering her.
But somehow she's happy to hear that.
{i}She's still shy.{/i}
Oh no!
What?
Don't look!
Why?
She's bathing.
But why?
We're watching the movie, aren't we?
But she's... naked.
It's not a big deal to watch a naked woman in a movie, Suzie.
But she looks like me, so...
So if she doesn't look like you, I could watch her naked body, right?
No, it's not like that.
{i}She's so cute.{/i}
{i}Should I kiss her?{/i}
{i}What am I waiting for?{/i}
{i}Last time, she pushed me away. I don't wanna be pushed again.{/i}
You and Suzie continue to watch the movie until the end.
No! [povname], um...
Um...
{i}Good, she accepts my kiss.{/i}
{i}Should I go for more?{/i}
{i}It's time for more now!{/i}
{i}I think I should stop here.{/i}
{i}Her thigh is so soft.{/i}
No, [povname]!
{i}Shit, she stops me!{/i}
Oh, I'm sorry.
{i}Maybe that's too fast for her.{/i}
How can you do that in the public?
I'm sorry, Suzie.
{i}Shit! Even the dark of a movie theater is the public for her!{/i}
I'm sorry.
But I'll catch a taxi to go home now.
Bye.
Hey!
{i}Shit!{/i}
You continue tasting her lips, until...
[povname], why are you kissing me?
What are you thinking about me?
{i}What am I thinking about her?{/i}
{i}A colleague? Just a woman to have sex with? Or more than that?{/i}
{i}Do I have feeling for her?{/i}
{i}How can I answer her?{/i}
I want us to... know more about each other.
I have feeling for you, Suzie.
Oh...
You and Suzie continue to watch the movie until the end.
Oh...
After the party at Mr George's place, I don't want to continue my relationship with Alex anymore.
But I need more time to think.
I don't want to rush into a new relationship when we don't know each other much.
Okay, Suzie.
We'll continue to be just friends like this.
After we know more about each other, we'll think about going steady at that time then.
Thank you, [povname].
You're so understanding.
But you have Emily now!
{i}Yeah, that's tough.{/i}
{i}How the hell would Emily accept this?{/i}
Yeah, you're right.
Hm... I'll discuss with Emily about this.
Oh...
I'll wait for you then.
At the clinic of Doctor Alphonso Areola tomorrow.
Are you ready for the second therapy, Ms Rothman?
Yeah.
I hope it's better this time.
But...
Why don't you follow me?
We're engaged!
What?
Alex? Is that you?
Who's Alex, Princess Myra?
What a weird name!
So not only Witter, you also have another man?
Witter? Who's he?
And why do you call me Princess?
It's time to go back now.
Hey, wait!
Wait...
Wait...
What's with your therapy?
I'm seeing stupid visions now.
Hm?
What kind of visions, Ms Rothman?
Last time I saw a friend at work.
This time I saw a close friend, who claimed that we were engaged.
Furthermore, he called me Princess.
And both of them dressed in some kind of medieval clothes.
Hm?
Do you believe in pre-incarnate life?
What's that, Doctor?
In some cultures, they say that life is just a circle.
You're born. You die. And you're born again.
Some times you still remember your previous life.
Especially when you couldn't finish some things before you died.
Well, the close friend actually was my love interest before I decided to date his childhood friend.
If I ran away from him in the previous life, it's not different in this life also.
Interesting.
I wonder what you'll see in the next therapy.
Well, not anymore.
That's enough for me.
Your therapy doesn't help me at all.
Too bad.
But it's up to you though.
{i}Hm... Suzie and the jerk Woody.{/i}
{i}Weird. Why is she behaving like that?{/i}
{i}It seems that the bad guy did something wrong.{/i}
{i}He's asking for her forgiveness, I think.{/i}
{i}Should I use this chance to ruin their relationship?{/i}
{i}Hell yeah! Why not?{/i}
{i}Nah. It's none of my business.{/i}
{i}Hmm... She seems to accept his appology soon.{/i}
{i}Well. I should go.{/i}
{i}I don't have anything to do here anyway.{/i}
Hey, Suzie.
You asked me to help you with your statistics.
Do you have time now?
Or do you want to ask Mr George?
I think he's free to help you now.
Yeah, let me help you.
No, thanks, Mr George.
Do you mind if we come to your desk, [povname]?
I don't mind. Let's go.
Hey, wait.
{i}Haha. Serve you right.{/i}
{i}Hm... the bald bastard comes here today?{/i}
An hour later.
{i}What a stupid customer.{/i}
{i}'You should stick to your plan. I'm only a customer, I don't know anything about this matter.'{/i}
{i}And one minute later: 'What the fuck! I'm the customer! You must listen to me!'{/i}
{i}Bullshit!{/i}
{i}Hm... There are some people inside.{/i}
{i}Should I have a look?{/i}
{i}No! When did I become a peeping tom?{/i}
{i}I have to make sure everything's fine.{/i}
{i}What? They're fucking here?{/i}
Um... um...
Please slow down... um...
I don't want anyone to know about this...
Why?
You're my woman now!
Um... no... slow down...
Kimochi?
No, I'm not Japanese...
Oh... it's so good...
Um... Don't come inside, please...
Why not? I did it twice already.
You're mine!
No...
Um...
{i}Shit! They're going to come soon!{/i}
{i}I should get out of here!{/i}
{i}Let's go back to my desk.{/i}
That night...
I'm still alive.
Mommy? Is that you?
What's with the outfit?
Wait a minute!
You're still that young?
Find me, Daughter.
But where are you?
Mommy!
Mommy!
Huff... huff..
It's only a dream!
Stupid therapy!
At work tomorrow.
{i}Hm?{/i}
{i}That woman looks so familiar.{/i}
Ms Bloom?
[povname]!
{i}Amy Bloom?{/i}
Why did you disappear, Ms Bloom?
And where have you been all these years?
How...
Hey, slow down.
I can't answer all of your questions at the same time.
When you and Amy Bloom are still chatting, Emily comes back to her desk, thinking...
{i}Five years has passed.{/i}
{i}Amy Bloom...{/i}
Five years ago.
I didn't do anything wrong, Headmistress.
You have to believe me.
I was young.
I understand that you have your physical need.
But to kiss your student...
Someone shoved me!
That was an accident!
But why did you say to him 'I also have feeling for you, you know?' after that?
I...
I have no choice, Ms Bloom.
I have to do this before whoever sent me the clip uploads it to the internet.
No, please!
I dreamt to become a teacher since I was just a kid!
I'm sorry, Ms Bloom.
No... (sniff)...
At present.
{i}Only [povname] and Alex were her students.{/i}
{i}No surprise that she didn't recognize me.{/i}
{i}But what's she doing here anyway?{/i}
{i}Mrs Headmistress didn't want to ruin the school's reputation.{/i}
{i}I had to leave in silence.{/i}
{i}Only me, Mrs Headmistress and the mysterious girl knew about that incident back then.{/i}
{i}I can't let him know about it... yet.{/i}
I... took a break.
After that, I joined a security company.
Some days ago, I was chosen to be the bodyguard of Mrs Park.
So, we're colleagues now, Ms Bloom?
Yeah. I think so.
After chatting with Ms Bloom, you go back to your desk.
{i}Hm... An email to all the employees from Mr Park?{/i}
{i}What is it this time?{/i}
{i}All employees will have a short vacation?{/i}
{i}We will go by his private planes?{/i}
{i}Why is it all of a sudden?{/i}
{i}That would be interesting if I didn't lose my position.{/i}
{i}Well, I can't change that though.{/i}
{i}Better prepare for the trip then.{/i}
Next Monday evening.
Good evening, Mrs Park and Ms...
Good evening, [povname].
Let me introduce you to my cousin, Dianne Beaumont.
Good evening, Ms Beaumont.
Good evening, [povname].
We'll get on this plane.
The rest will go on the second plane with my husband.
See you on the plane, [povname].
Yeah, see you, Mrs Park.
Hi, [povname].
Hi, Ms Bloom.
Call me Amy now.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
Yeah, I still forget about that.
Want to sit next to me on the plane?
I'm sorry, I have to follow Mrs Park.
Oh, yeah.
You're her bodyguard now.
See you later.
See you.
{i}Ah... My head hurts.{/i}
[povname]... [povname]...
[povname], [povname]!
Uhm...
Thank God, you're okay!
What happened? Ouch...
You don't remember anything?
Er... I only remember that we got on the plane and now I'm here.
Our plane crashed.
What?
But it was lucky that we're safe.
Ah... my head's still hurt.
Maybe your head hit a rock or something so you forgot everything.
Er, Mrs Park's here too?
Of course, I was on the same plane. (Yawning)
Remember there were more people on the plane,
Not just you two love birds.
Er... I'm not his lover!
Well, my eyes are sharp, you know.
Don't tease them anymore, Katie.
Hm... I hope I have enough sunscream.
You're here too, Ms Beaumont?
What do you expect?
I died in the plane crash?
No, I didn't mean that!
Don't worry.
I'm just kidding.
Well, you should change your clothes like us, too.
It'll be more convenient.
Yeah, before my husband comes rescue us, let's have some fun!
Be careful, Katie!
It's getting dark soon!
Alright, alright. I'm not a kid.
Let's spend the night here.
I still have some food and water in my bag.
Tomorrow we'll have a look at this place before someone rescues us.
Er, okay.
{i}Looks like she's in charge here...{/i}
They think they'll be rescued soon, and other people think so too.
My wife will hire a rescue team to find us soon, don't worry.
We've got plenty of money.
I'm not worried when there are many hot women around me, haha.
{i}But I'm worried.{/i}
So, tell me, Doctor.
Why am I meeting you here?
Relax, I'm not here for the therapy.
I'm just a friend of Mr Park, Ms Rothman.
To tell you the truth, I'm still seeing weird visions although I don't take the therapy anymore.
Interesting.
Do you mind telling me about your visions, Ms Rothman.
Oh, forget about them.
Just silly dreams.
Hey guys, bad news.
After exploring around, it seems that we're stuck on an isolated island.
We're surrounded by an ocean.
Except a cave and a stream but there's no way to go through it.
Well, I think we should stay here for the night then.
Tomorrow we'll make signs so that whoever passes by can save us.
Let's go to the cave we found to stay for the night then.
It's not far from here.
Er... Did you meet the pilot?
No, we couldn't see the pilot anywhere.
{i}What a fucking vacation!{/i}
Here, this is the cave we talked about.
Oh my gosh! What a fantastic vacation!
Stop complaining, Olivia.
We're all in this trouble.
But it's not my fault!
Alright, enough.
Let's sit down and discuss about what we'll do tomorrow.
Next morning.
{i}Hm... sleeping in that cave was so awful.{/i}
{i}I hardly slept at all.{/i}
{i}I'll wait here to watch the sunrise then.{/i}
{i}Hm.. Is it just me or this view's so familiar?{/i}
You couldn't sleep, right?
{i}What the...!{/i}
{i}It's just like my vision!{/i}
Er... you too, Alex?
Yeah.
You know, Emily...
Hey, wait...
I'm not engaged to you!
What are you talking about?
Er, nevermind.
{i}Oops, I was paranoid again.{/i}
Hi there.
Uhm... Mr Park said that since everyone couldn't sleep anymore, we should cast lots now.
{i}Suzie told me that she wasn't in a relationship with Alex anymore after Woody's birthday party.{/i}
{i}I think what comes easy won't last long then.{/i}
Alright, let's go.
After casting lots, they split into three groups.
Emily and Alex come to the stream to get some water.
Suzie and Woody go into the forest to find vegetables to eat and some wood to burn at night.
The rest stay back at the beach to make an S.O.S sign.
Hey, Emily.
This is the stream Woody and I found yesterday.
Before going with Alex, Emily had a chat with Doctor Areola.
And what he said is still troubling her now.
{i}According to the eastern myth, you and your friends have some unfinished things in your previous life.{/i}
{i}That's why you all meet again in this life so you can finish the unfinished things.{/i}
{i}What's unfinished?{/i}
{i}Is it about the engagement the man looked like Alex said to me?{/i}
Hey, Emily.
Are you listening to me?
Oh, sorry, Alex.
I was... nevermind though.
Are you tired?
Uhm...
Let's have a rest then.
Yeah.
{i}He's always thoughtful, just like when we were in highschool.{/i}
{i}Alex was my first friend when I transferred to the new school.{/i}
{i}I nearly became his girlfriend before...{/i}
{i}Wait a minute...{/i}
{i}The long hair Alex also said something like I abandonned him for another man, didn't he?{/i}
{i}I did ditch him in highschool for...{/i}
Are you okay, Emily?
You seem so strange today.
I'm okay, Alex, don't worry.
{i}He always knows when I have something in my mind.{/i}
{i}The guy in my vision looked like a prince.{/i}
{i}Was I his princess?{/i}
Your head's a little warm.
Are you sure you're okay?
Er?
I'm okay, Alex.
{i}No, even if I was his princess, I ditched him in the end.{/i}
And I think it's time for us to take some water and go back.
{i}Let's stop it here before everything's getting out of my control.{/i}
Uhm... Okay.
I'm okay, Alex.
Are you sure, Emily?
I'm sure.
{i}Don't get any closer, Alex. Or I...{/i}
Then why is your breath heavy?
What? No!
It's not heavy!
{i}My heart is starting to race too!{/i}
I know when you're lying, Emily.
Um...
{i}Just... let it be then.{/i}
Um...
{i}My first kiss was with him when we were just teenagers.{/i}
{i}It was to know how a kiss liked.{/i}
{i}My heart wasn't racing like this.{/i}
{i}And he didn't touch my breasts...{/i}
No, Alex...
Although she says no, she only pushes him lightly.
That doesn't prevent him from starting to feel the breast he dreams about every night.
Um...
Alex continues kissing her, stopping her from saying anything else.
Um... um...
{i}He's good at this.{/i}
{i}Not the shy kid anymore...{/i}
Um...
Er...
No, Alex!
We can't do this in broad day light!
What if someone sees us?
You mean we can continue at night, right?
I'm not saying that.
Let's take some water and go back.
Okay.
At the same time, Suzie and Woody also find another water source.
Wow, there's also fresh water here, Woody.
Hm... We didn't find it yesterday.
After filling up their bottles,
How I miss this feeling!
I don't like the feeling of sea water at all.
Yeah, me too.
Can I join you, Suzie?
I don't know what you mean.
I don't have the right to stop you from stepping in this pond.
I mean this.
Oh!
Please behave yourself, Woody.
Don't be shy.
But if you say so...
I think we should go back.
Woody, don't...
Er...
What are you doing, Woody?
Oh...
Stop it, Woody...
Oh...
Um...
Woody... Don't...
Um... um...
{i}What's this feeling...{/i}
Stop...
{i}It's... good...{/i}
Of course, I won't stop.
No, I mean... um...
{i}It's different from how I touch myself...{/i}
{i}It's time for my boy to meet her girl. Hehe.{/i}
Er?
No, Woody!
Stop!
Uhm, okay, Suzie.
{i}She's still a little bit shy.{/i}
{i}I should stop here and wait for the next chance then.{/i}
I wanna go back.
At the mean time, after you finished making the S.O.S sign with Dianne...
{i}Ms Bloom?{/i}
{i}What's she doing here?{/i}
[povname]?
What are doing here, Ms Bloom?
I'm just thinking...
But call me Amy, will you?
I'm not your teacher anymore.
{i}Yeah, she's not my teacher anymore.{/i}
{i}And she's only around 4 or 5 years older than me.{/i}
{i}Should I call her Amy from now on?{/i}
Well, it's up to you though.
{i}Oops, I think I should change the subject.{/i}
What were you thinking before I came here?
I'm worried.
What will happen if we're stuck here forever?
Why do I always get into trouble when I...
Tell me, [povname].
Do you have a girlfriend right now?
{i}Weird, why is she asking me about that?{/i}
I don't have anyone right now.
You want to introduce me to someone?
Yeah, maybe to my twin sister.
Wow, you have a twin sister?
Of course not.
Well, I have to go, see ya.
{i}Should I tell her about Emily?{/i}
{i}Well, Emily wasn't in her class.{/i}
{i}She doesn't know about her.{/i}
{i}But should I tell her that I'm in a relationship right now?{/i}
{i}Yes, of course.{/i}
{i}Well, Emily isn't here though.{/i}
Well, I'm in a relationship with a... colleague.
I'll introduce her to you later when we're back.
Well, I... have to go now.
See ya.
I don't have anyone right now.
You want to introduce me to someone?
Yeah, maybe to my twin sister.
Wow, you have a twin sister?
Of course not.
Well, I have to go, see ya.
Hey Olivia, Emily!
Come out and see, it's beautiful!
You guys go ahead.
There's no fucking thing can be called beautiful on this damn island!
Er...
Ignore her, Suzie.
I'll go with you.
Yeah. See you later, Olivia.
Ugh...
It's beautiful, right?
What the...
The first vision!
What vision, Emily?
Oh, nevermind.
This scene reminds me about the time when I was just a little girl.
I would look at the starry sky every night,
{i}At least she didn't wait for something...{/i}
Waiting for a prince charming to come by the east wind...
{i}What the hell!{/i}
Do you think that's silly, Emily?
No, I think all girls have that dream when they're just little girls.
Oh... Alex...
Hi there.
Um... I remember I have something to do.
See you guys later.
{i}Lame excuse.{/i}
{i}There's nothing for us to do here.{/i}
{i}It seems that she's still uneasy around Alex.{/i}
Emily, I'm...
Oh, sorry, Alex, I...
I have something to do also.
{i}Ugh... lame excuse also.{/i}
{i}But I think I should avoid him from now on.{/i}
{i}I don't want him to dream about a relationship with me anymore.{/i}
Okay, good night, Emily.
Good night, Alex.
Emily, I'm...
Are you serious?
You want us to continue what we did this morning right here right now?
No, I didn't mean that.
I just want to know what we are at the moment.
Um... about that...
I've just broken up with [povname], I need more time, Alex.
Okay.
I'll wait for your answer.
Good night, Alex.
Good night, Emily.
{i}Another vision today.{/i}
{i}Will I also see the third vision?{/i}
{i}Well, maybe not.{/i}
{i}My mother can't be so young like that in the vision.{/i}
{i}But where's she now?{/i}
{i}Why didn't she keep her promise...{/i}
Tomorrow.
Wow, it's really beautiful, Suzie!
Hell yeah!
I don't care about the beauty.
I only know that I'll have fresh water to clean my vagina now.
Woohoo!
Eww...
Watch your language, Olivia!
Why don't you take off your swimsuit, Suzie?
No guy's around here, don't worry.
She's right, Suzie.
Just relax.
Er... I'm not used to be naked in the public.
Oh, really?
People have to be naked in an onsen in Japan, right?
Oh my gosh!
What the...
You were following us here?
Woohoo.
Let's get out of here, Suzie.
Well, well...
What do we have here...
The biggest cock you've ever seen, of course.
Not even close.
But there's nothing to play here anyway.
Oh... oh...
Yeah... fuck me... fuck me...
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm fucking you, of course.
Harder... harder...
Yeah...
Like that...
Ah... I'm close now...
Ah...
Keep going...
Are you on the pill, girl?
Safe day, don't worry.
Oh... oh...
Ah...
Receive my seeds, girl... Oh...
Oh...
{i}Hm... Mrs Park doesn't swim today?{/i}
{i}What's she doing there?{/i}
Hey, Mrs Park.
What are you doing here?
You think I wanted to do that?
Er... I think you wanted to do what?
You're a fucking cheater who can't even help his woman when she needs you.
Wait... what?
I hate you!
What?
What did I do?
Just ignore her, [povname].
Oh shit!
You startled me!
When did you come here?
I was here just right after you.
What about Mrs Park?
Why did she get angry like that?
Hmm...
She looks at you, considering if she should discuss with you about Mrs Park's problem.
I think we'll be stuck here for some times.
It's better for you to know about this.
But you shouldn't tell this to anyone else.
Do you promise?
Yeah... I promise.
As you know, we're cousins.
Our families were very poor.
When she was only 16 and I was 24, we left Corsica, looking for a better life.
She was young and beautiful.
Many guys chased her, including Mr Park.
But she fell for a young man.
They were deeply in love.
Unlucky, her mother got sick.
She needed a lot of money to send back home.
Her boyfriend couldn't help her.
He even slept with her friend.
Heartbroken, she accepted to become Mr Park's wife since he promised to help her mother.
That's the whole story.
Er... That's it?
Yeah.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
But that doesn't explain why she yelled at me!
Oh, I forgot to tell you about that.
You look a lot like her ex-boyfriend.
What? The cheating boyfriend?
Exactly.
And it seems that 2 days stuck here makes her start to lose it.
She can't endure so much stress.
Now it makes her remember the bastard when you're around her.
I hope someone will rescue us soon.
And please don't tell anyone about what I've just told you.
Uhm... okay.
{i}Maybe that explains why Mr Park doesn't like me at all.{/i}
At the same time.
{i}I know sooner or later I'll lose my virginity to the man I love.{/i}
{i}But is Woody the right one?{/i}
At the same time.
{i}Can I ever run away from Jim Brie?{/i}
At the same time.
{i}Right when I start to have feeling for [povname], I'm stuck here with many men for how long I don't know.{/i}
{i}I wish [povname] will come to rescue me soon.{/i}
At the same time.
{i}Can someone rescue me from this island?...{/i}
{i}It's so beautiful at night here.{/i}
{i}It would be great if we were on this island for the vacation.{/i}
{i}2 days already.{/i}
{i}I wonder what [povname]'s doing right now.{/i}
Emily.
Yes, Alex?
Care to join me for a walk?
Right now?
Yeah.
I'm not sure. It's a little bit late.
{i}Walking together under the full moon on an isolated island?{/i}
{i}What if he continues to have feeling for me?{/i}
{i}Although I broke up with [povname], I couldn't forget about him.{/i}
{i}Why hasn't he tried to get me back?{/i}
{i}He didn't take care of me like Alex always did.{/i}
{i}Why did I leave Alex for him?{/i}
Would you go with me, Emi?
It's been so long since the last time I heard that name.
I couldn't call you Emi anymore since you...
Where do you want us to go, Alex?
To the pond I heard Woody talked about.
Okay, let's go then.
{i}Emi was the name Alex called me in high school.{/i}
{i}It means beauty or a smile in Japanese.{/i}
What are you thinking, Emily?
Just a sweet memory, Alex.
{i}She thinks about [povname]?{/i}
Isn't it so bright tonight, Alex?
Yeah, it's full moon.
I wonder what [povname] and the others are doing right now.
{i}She's thinking about him...{/i}
It's 2 days now.
When will they rescue us, Alex?
Don't worry, Emi.
We'll leave here soon.
Even if no one comes to rescue us, we still can live here.
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Alex, you always say sweet things just to cheer me up.
No, I'm telling you the truth!
We could always be together!
Well, it's a little bit late, Alex.
I think I should go back to get some sleep.
{i}I'm sorry, Alex.{/i}
{i}My heart belongs to [povname] only.{/i}
Alex, I know that I'm not [povname]'s girlfriend anymore.
But isn't it too early to discuss about that?
I've been in love with you for 7 years now!
It's not early!
I know that, but...
{i}I know he loves me.{/i}
{i}But I still have feeling for [povname].{/i}
{i}If I accept him now, am I just like a cheater?{/i}
{i}Isn't that wrong to be with him but my heart still belongs to [povname]?{/i}
{i}She still thinks about [povname].{/i}
{i}If I let this continues, she'll always be indecisive like this.{/i}
{i}No! I can't continue living like this!{/i}
{i}She's mine! Not [povname]'s!{/i}
Er?
What are you doing, Alex?
I love you, Emily!
I know that, but get off of me!
No, I'll never let you go again!
You're mine!
You're crazy!
I'm not yours!
{i}He positioned himself between my crotch already!{/i}
Stop it! Alex!
Never!
Why didn't you love me after all I did for you?
Alex...
When you were sad, you would go look for me.
But in the end, you would go back to [povname]!
Why?
Alex...
{i}I know I didn't treat him well.{/i}
{i}But how could I control my feeling?{/i}
{i}Oh no... he pulled down my panty!{/i}
{i}What should I do?{/i}
Stop it!
Slap!
The slap somehow woke Alex up.
He just sits still when Emily's leaving.
I'll never want to see your face again, Alex!
{i}I think that's all my fault.{/i}
{i}I knew he still loved me but I kept finding him when I was sad.{/i}
{i}Maybe I should let him make love with me just this time...{/i}
{i}His penis is preparing to enter me!{/i}
Alex, I'm not wet yet!
I don't care, you're mine!
Ouch, Alex!
{i}My vagina's so dry...{/i}
{i}It's hurt...{/i}
How do you feel, Emily?
I'm hurt, Alex...
You feel hurt with me, but feel good with [povname]?
Don't say that!
You're crazy, Alex...
Why not?
You're mine now but still thinking about him, Emily?
{i}Alex's crazy now.{/i}
{i}That's all my fault...{/i}
{i}Where's [povname] now?{/i}
{i}Does he know that I still love him?...{/i}
Oh... oh... you're so tight, Emily...
Mm... mm...
{i}What the hell are you doing, Emily?{/i}
{i}You love [povname] but you're letting his close friend fuck you?{/i}
Oh... oh...
{i}But... I'm starting to feel good.{/i}
{i}It's not hurt anymore.{/i}
Oh... oh...
I'm coming, Emily!
Outside, Alex!
No, you're mine!
Oh...
Ugh...
{i}He released inside me...{/i}
{i}Just when I started to feel good though.{/i}
{i}It's been two weeks since the last time already...{/i}
{i}I want more...{/i}
{i}What am I thinking?{/i}
{i}That's enough already!{/i}
Let go off me, Alex!
Emily, I...
That's okay, Alex.
Just... leave me alone.
{i}But that's absolutely not a good decision to jump on him right now.{/i}
{i}I think I just let his penis stay inside of me for some more minutes.{/i}
{i}Oh my gosh!{/i}
{i}It's... hard again!{/i}
Oh... oh...
Oh... I love you, Emily...
Mm...mm...
Stop saying that, Alex... oh...
This isn't how to show love...
Mm... mm...
{i}He's speeding up, don't tell me he's coming again...{/i}
{i}No, I'm not satisfied yet...{/i}
Hey, Alex, let me on top of you...
You want to come, too?
No, it's just that... you're hurting me...
Oh... oh...
{i}Every time I want to come, I always climb on top of [povname].{/i}
{i}Somehow I could come easily this way.{/i}
Oh... fuck...
You're so good, Emily!
Oh... oh...
I'm coming, Emily!
{i}I'm gonna come too...{/i}
Oh... oh...
Ugh...
Mm... mm...
I want to love you every day, Emily...
{i}I rode another dick not [povname]'s and came...{/i}
Next morning.
We're going to run out of water soon.
Would you please go find some fresh water source?
Or look to see if there are some coconut trees or any kind of plants that have water inside of them.
Okay, Dianne.
And please go with Amy.
You shouldn't go alone.
It's better to have someone to help you if something happens.
I'll stay here with Katie.
I understand.
I'm going now.
See you later.
Okay, see you.
Wow, there's a stream here!
We don't have to worry about water anymore.
Yeah.
Look at those pebbles.
Does it remind you about something, [povname]?
About what, Ms Bloom?
Er, well, Amy?
When you were 4 years old and I was 7 years old?
Er, I only remember that I was staying at my grandmother's place for the summer and met you there.
That's all?
Yeah, was there something else, Amy?
Well, no.
After that you came back to the city and we only met again when I became your teacher in high school.
Yeah.
Well, I think we should get the water and go back, shall we?
Okay.
{i}It seems that he doesn't remember at all.{/i}
{i}Well, he was just a little kid back then.{/i}
19 years ago.
Haha, that was fun, Amy.
Yeah, so much fun, hihi.
But why did they chase you, Amy?
Well, they pick on me everyday because I'm an orphan.
But thanks to you, I had fun today.
I didn't do anything.
I only threw some pebbles at them and ran away.
Well, that was the first time someone standing up for me.
Too bad that I'm smaller than those girls.
When I grow up, I'll marry you and protect you!
I promise!
Silly, you'll leave here soon.
I'll come back.
Don't worry.
{i}In the end, he completely forgot what he said.{/i}
{i}And we only met again 14 years later.{/i}
Shit! I'm late right on the first day of the new semester!
Sorry, Miss... eh...
Ms Bloom.
Sorry, Ms Bloom. I overslept.
Everyone's in the gym house already.
I'll note down that you're late today.
Aw...
Hm... your face looks familiar.
Did we met before?
Well, tell me your name so that I could note it down.
I'm [povname].
[povname]?
You're the cousin of Anne Abbot, right?
Yes, I am.
Wow, you've grown up into a young man!
Er? You are?
Amy! I'm Amy!
We hung around when you came to visit your grandmother, remember?
Oh... I'm starting to... remember now.
After grandma died, I didn't come there anymore.
Yeah, it's been a long time already.
So could you, er, don't note down my name, please?
Okay, I'll let you go this time.
But only this time, remember that.
Yay, thanks, Amy!
Oh, sorry, Ms Bloom!
{i}I didn't think at that time that I would fall in love with him later.{/i}
Oh, you guys are here too?
Olivia?
Well, it seems that no one will come to rescue us now.
Meanwhile,
{i}5 years already.{/i}
{i}Where's that bastard right now?{/i}
5 years ago.
You said you loved me!
Why did you sleep with my closest friend?
Well, she needed my cock, just like you.
Fuck you! Asshole!
I'm going to marry Mr Park!
You think I'll let you do that?
{i}I was worried that he would come to the wedding.{/i}
{i}Even until now, I wonder why he didn't.{/i}
{i}He felt pity for me in the end?{/i}
{i}Tsk. I think she's thinking about the asshole again.{/i}
{i}I tried so hard to get rid of him.{/i}
{i}Now [povname] reminds her about that bastard.{/i}
{i}Still, she doesn't know why he didn't come to disturb her wedding.{/i}
{i}Well, she doesn't need to know.{/i}
{i}No one needs to know.{/i}
Well well well, what did you ask me to come here for, Dianne?
How much do you want to leave her alone?
I don't think you have enough money for me, Dianne.
Even if I have to pay you monthly, I'll do that until it's enough for you.
Just leave her alone!
Well, but no money right now.
How could I believe that you'll keep your promise?
Is this enough for you to stay away from her?
Well well well, Dianne.
I have to admit that you're in good shape for a 30 year old woman. Hehe.
Deal?
With this, I'll stay away from her for now.
But to leave her alone forever, I need some money, Dianne.
Deal. I'll give you your damn money.
Just make it quick before she's home.
{i}Well, just think about that makes me feel sick.{/i}
Hey! I found Mr Park and the others!
What?
Amy is staying with them now.
They have a cave, we don't need to sleep outside anymore!
Let's go!
Well, this is good.
What?
Both planes crashed but everyone's safe.
No one arrived at the resort.
My agent would be notified about this.
They're tracking us along the route now.
Until then, let's keep making S.O.S signs along the beach.
At least I have you now, [povname].
Yeah. I'm happy to see you're safe and sound, Emily.
{i}He promised to discuss with her about our relationship...{/i}
{i}So she's his girlfriend?{/i}
{i}He told me he wasn't in any relationship?{/i}
That night.
This place's so beautiful.
Do you think so too, [povname]?
Yeah, Emily.
If we weren't trapped here, it would be a nice place to spend time together.
Come with me, [povname].
Where to, Emily?
You'll see.
Why are you taking me here, Emily?
I want to have some private time with you.
For what, Emily?
Why are you asking that question?
Can't a girl meet his man in a private place?
{i}Does she mean that she wants some intimacy here?{/i}
It's beautiful here, [povname].
Look, I'm happy now.
Why, Emily?
{i}Shit, her bikini shows me a good view.{/i}
{i}Her boobs are so inviting.{/i}
{i}I want to fuck her right away!{/i}
I was worried the past few days.
But if we're stuck here, at least I would be with you for the rest of my life.
{i}I can't restrain myself anymore!{/i}
{i}No, I have to respect her!{/i}
I'm a little bit tired after walking all day long.
{i}Shouldn't let others seeing her naked body if they accidently come here when I'm fucking her!{/i}
Let's go back, Emily.
We'll talk more tomorrow.
Okay, let's go back, [povname].
Let's sit over there, Woody.
Yeah, Suzie.
Well well well, Suzie.
What is it, Woody?
Alone in this place at night.
Aren't you scared after what I did last time?
If you do anything like that again, we won't talk anymore!
Relax, Suzie.
I mean that I'm happy.
Why are you happy, Woody?
I've just been annoyed but you're happy?
That's ridiculous!
I'm happy because I know that you love me now.
That's why you didn't hesitate to ask me here without any worry.
No, it's not like that!
Then it's like what, Suzie?
You don't have any feeling for me?
Uhm...
Well, you're a good man.
You're strong.
I feel safe around you.
I like you.
But I need more time to fall in love with you.
Need more time for what, Suzie?
To know more about each other, you know.
But if we're not dating, how could we know more about each other?
Friends can know more about each other, right, Woody?
But that's different.
If you don't give me a chance to show you my love, how can you know if I'm suited for you or not?
Uhm... I don't know...
Well, if you don't want it.
That's fine.
{i}Let's see if she'll be worried about losing me or not...{/i}
{i}He's looking away.{/i}
{i}Is he upset?{/i}
{i}To think about that, I went out with him twice already.{/i}
{i}Is he disappointed that I still refuse to date him now?{/i}
{i}What if he stops liking me?{/i}
{i}Should I give him a chance?{/i}
Well, I'm going back now.
{i}Shit!{/i}
{i}If he's not patient, he's not the right man!{/i}
It's not like I don't want to.
But I only like you now.
It's not love yet.
Furthermore, I want to be a virgin on my wedding night.
But people in this country don't care much about virginity.
{i}Shit!{/i}
So I'm worried that if I accept to date you now, you might...
What are you saying, Suzie?
Do you think I'm just trying to get into your pants here?
No, I...
I love you and want to take care of you.
I know that some girls want to keep their virginity until marriage.
Furthermore, I'm not that kind of guy you're talking about!
If you don't trust me, how could we start a relationship even after you know enough about me?
I'm sorry, Woody.
I didn't mean that.
It's fine, Suzie.
I think you don't want to date me after all.
No, I didn't mean that!
Um...
Let's start dating.
You didn't say that just to cheer me up, did you?
Of course not!
But remember that we won't have sex until marriage!
That's good.
Let's start dating without sex, haha.
{i}Not for long, baby.{/i}
{i}There's no virgin can refuse me.{/i}
Yeah, hihi.
Er?
What are you doing, [povname]?
I love you, Emily!
I know that, but what if people see us?
No one's coming here.
But what if they come?
{i}He positioned himself between my crotch already!{/i}
Hey, [povname]!
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
What if they come?
So what?
Can't a man fuck his girlfriend?
But...
{i}His penis is preparing to enter me!{/i}
[povname], I'm not wet yet!
You will after some minutes, trust me!
{i}I'm too horny to stop now!{/i}
Ouch, [povname]!
{i}My vagina's so dry...{/i}
{i}It's hurt...{/i}
So good, Emily... ah... ah...
Oh... slow down, [povname]...
It's hurt...
My vagina's so dry...
It will be wet soon... oh... oh...
Mm... mm...
Do you love me, [povname]?
I love you, Emily...
Then don't do this again, okay?
Okay, Emily... oh...
Mm... mm...
{i}I'm starting to get wet down there...{/i}
See, Emily?
I knew you would get wet soon.
Mm... mm...
I'm going faster now!
Oh... oh...
So good... [povname]...
Do you love me, Emily?
Love... love... mm... mm...
I love... mm... mm... you... mm... mm...
Love me more... [povname]... love me more... mm... mm...
I'm coming... Emily...
Faster... faster...
Make me come too... mm... mm...
Oh... I'm coming now... oh...
A little bit more... honey... oh...
Fuck me just a little bit more... oh...
Oh...
Ugh...
{i}I didn't come yet...{/i}
{i}If he had waited for a little bit more...{/i}
{i}Oh my gosh!{/i}
{i}It's... hard again!{/i}
Oh... oh...
You're not tired, [povname]?
I want to make you come too, Emily.
Mm... I love you, [povname]...
I love you, too, Emily.
Mm... mm...
Good... mm...
Faster... faster...
Make me come, [povname]... oh... oh...
Hey, [povname], let me on top of you...
You want to come that much, Emily?
No, it's just that... I'm worried that you'll be too tired to continue...
Oh... okay, Emily.
{i}I know she's just embarrassed to say that she wants to come so badly.{/i}
Oh... oh...
{i}Every time I want to come, I always climb on top of [povname].{/i}
{i}Somehow I could come easily this way.{/i}
Oh... oh...
You're so good, Emily!
Oh... no...
What the...
They're fucking here!
Let's go back, Woody!
Why?
You couldn't see people fucking like this everyday, could you?
But...
Don't worry, just keep silent and watch them.
{i}It's not like I want to watch them.{/i}
{i}But this is the first time I've seen this in reality.{/i}
{i}I'm curious.{/i}
{i}But watching together with Woody?{/i}
{i}I guess I just watch them in silence then.{/i}
{i}Emily is riding him now.{/i}
{i}Is this what they call cowgirl position?{/i}
{i}Let her watch until she has some reaction. Hehe.{/i}
{i}How does that feel?{/i}
{i}Is it better than just laying there and let the man does what he wants?{/i}
{i}I'm so curious.{/i}
{i}Oh, my pussy's getting wet down there!{/i}
{i}She's blushing. Good. It's time now.{/i}
{i}I think I should leave now.{/i}
Oh!
What are you doing, Woody?
Continue what we did last time.
No, I said stop last time.
And this time also!
Just relax, Suzie.
Oh!
{i}He's putting his hand just outside my pussy!{/i}
Looks like someone's dripping wet down there, eh?
No, that's... sweat!
Pussy's not dripping sweat, Suzie.
No, that's...
You're horny watching them, right?
No, I'm not!
Let's see then.
S... stop it! Woody!
Oh... oh...
Looks like your body's not lying, eh?
Mm... mm...
How do you feel, Suzie?
Mm... mm...
Do you usually touch yourself when you're alone?
No! Oh...
{i}What's this feeling?{/i}
{i}It's... so good...{/i}
{i}My pussy feels like it's melting just by the tip of his finger.{/i}
{i}Why is his finger so hot like this?...{/i}
Mm... mm...
Do you feel good, Suzie?
Don't... ask me... that...
It's embarrassed... mm...
{i}Look likes she's gonna come soon.{/i}
Oh... please... Woody...
I know what you need, Suzie.
Please... stop...
Trust me, I'll make you feel good.
Mm... mm...
{i}What's this feeling?{/i}
{i}Something's coming...{/i}
{i}No... I can't stand on my feet anymore...{/i}
Mm... mm...
{i}Something's coming...{/i}
{i}It's near...{/i}
{i}It's...{/i}
Ahh...
Oh my...
What an orgasm...
{i}I didn't even put my finger into her vagina yet.{/i}
{i}I was just rubbing outside of it.{/i}
{i}It seems that she doesn't have much experience in touching herself.{/i}
I... I'm tired, Woody.
I... want to go back.
{i}Huhm... I guess I should wait for another chance to eat her then. Haha.{/i}
Okay, let's go back, Suzie.
Stop it!
I hate you!
{i}Shit!{/i}
I'm going back now!
Hey, Suzie, wait!
No, I have to go back!
Well, let's go back then.
{i}Shit! What a waste!{/i}
Oh... oh...
I'm coming, Emily!
I'm gonna come too...
Oh... oh...
Ugh...
Mm... mm...
Why are you taking me here, Suzie?
You don't want to be with me, [povname]?
It's not like that.
But we're alone here.
Aren't you scared of what I could do to you?
If you do anything, we won't talk anymore!
Relax, Suzie.
Just kidding.
But I'm happy.
Why are you happy, [povname]?
I've just been annoyed but you're happy?
That's ridiculous!
I'm happy because I know that you have feeling for me now.
That's why you didn't hesitate to take me here without any worry.
No, it's not like that!
Then it's like what, Suzie?
You don't have any feeling for me?
Uhm...
Well, you're a good man.
I feel safe around you.
I like you.
But I need more time to fall in love with you.
Need more time for what, Suzie?
To know more about each other, you know.
{i}She needs time.{/i}
{i}But if this continues, I'm not sure when will she fall for me.{/i}
{i}Should I show her that if she doesn't have a direct answer, I'll stop chasing her?{/i}
I guess you're right.
We should know more about each other.
Thank you for your understanding, [povname].
But if we're not dating, how could we know more about each other?
Friends can know more about each other, right, [povname]?
But that's different.
If you don't give me a chance to show you my love, how can you know if I'm suited for you or not?
Uhm... I don't know...
Well, if you don't want it.
That's fine.
{i}Let's see if she'll be worried about losing me or not...{/i}
{i}He's looking away.{/i}
{i}Is he upset?{/i}
{i}Think about that, I went out with him already.{/i}
{i}Is he disappointed that I still refuse to date him now?{/i}
{i}What if he stops liking me?{/i}
{i}Should I give him a chance?{/i}
It's not like I don't want to.
But I only like you now.
It's not love yet.
Furthermore, I want to be a virgin on my wedding night.
But people in this country don't care much about virginity.
So I'm worried that if I accept to date you now, you might...
What are you saying, Suzie?
Do you think I'm just trying to get into your pants here?
{i}Who doesn't want to?{/i}
No, I...
I just want to take care of you.
I know that some girls want to keep their virginity until marriage.
Furthermore, I'm not that kind of guy you're talking about!
{i}Who's not that kind of guy?{/i}
If you don't trust me, how could we start a relationship even after you know enough about me?
I'm sorry, [povname].
I didn't mean that.
It's fine, Suzie.
I think you don't want to date me after all.
No, it's not like that.
Um...
Let's start dating.
You didn't say that just to cheer me up, did you?
Of course not!
But remember that we won't have sex until marriage.
That's good.
Let's start dating.
Yeah, hihi.
Next morning.
{i}Well, at least we have water and some food here.{/i}
[povname]!
What is it, Amy?
They came here!
Helicopters!
Wow, let's go back, Amy!
At the same time...
You've found where she's living now? (Speaking in Mandarin)
That city? (Speaking in Mandarin)
Hm... No wonder why we couldn't find her. (Speaking in Mandarin)
She's working in a small company (Speaking in Mandarin)?
How dumb she is. (Speaking in Mandarin)
Prepare everything. (Speaking in Mandarin)
I'll go after finishing some small businesses. (Speaking in Mandarin)
Are you clear? (Speaking in Mandarin)
Good. Now start preparing. (Speaking in Mandarin)
I have to go now. (Speaking in Mandarin)
{i}It's time to take you home, Qiu-Shui. (Thinking in Mandarin){/i}
A day after everyone's rescued from the island, [povname] is relaxing at home.
{i}Home sweet home!{/i}
{i}What a vacation it was!{/i}
{i}Well, everything's fine now.{/i}
{i}Even though having some beautiful women around just like staying at the island is a good idea, I just want to live alone like this.{/i}
{i}Women are so noisy!{/i}
Next morning.
{i}Well, it's time to go to work.{/i}
{i}I hope everything's fine now.{/i}
{i}Hmm? Who is Olivia speaking to so early in the morning?{/i}
{i}Customers don't come here so early in the morning like this.{/i}
Oh, the guy who could help you is here finally.
Me?
{i}So lucky, I'll let him deal with her.{/i}
{i}I didn't apply to help people find their families.{/i}
Er, good morning.
How could I help you?
Good morning, Mister.
I'm Li Qiu-Yue.
{i}Lee What?{/i}
I'm looking for my sister who's working here.
Could you tell me something about your sister?
{i}Hmm, this girl looks familiar.{/i}
Because there are many companies in this building.
{i}Maybe I've seen her sister in this building before.{/i}
I'm not sure if your sister is working in the same company with me or not.
Her name is Li Qiu-Shui.
She's 3 years older than me.
Well, I don't know anyone with that name.
{i}I can't even repeat the name.{/i}
Yue-Yue?
Jie-jie!
What?
Yue-Yue! What are you doing here? (Speaking in Mandarin)
{i}Oh, so this is Suzie's sister.{/i}
I miss you, jie-jie. (Speaking in Mandarin)
{i}No wonder why she looks so familiar.{/i}
[povname], this is my sister, Qiu-Yue.
Yeah, we had a chat before you came.
{i}The problem is that I still can't repeat her name.{/i}
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning, Mr George.
{i}Good morning, bastard.{/i}
Well, why is there a girl looks a lot like you here, Ms Lee?
Oh, this is my sister, Li Qiu-Yue.
Yue-Yue, this is my boss, Mr George.
Oh, nice to meet you, Ms Li.
Nice to meet you, too.
Um, Mr George, would you please let me have a day off today?
I'm very sorry but my sister comes to visit me so...
That's okay, don't worry.
Just remember to fill the form from the HR department.
Thank you, Mr George.
Some minutes later, you're at your desk.
{i}Judging from how they met this morning, I guess Suzie didn't know that her sister would come here to find her.{/i}
{i}And why did she come here?{/i}
{i}Why didn't she come to her house?{/i}
{i}Ah, well, none of my business though.{/i}
{i}Back to work.{/i}
{i}Hm... I was thinking about changing job around the time that bastard invited me to his birthday party.{/i}
{i}Now I'm starting to think why don't I start my own business?{/i}
Meanwhile, Suzie takes Yue-Yue to Corsica, the ice cream parlor of Dianne Beaumont.
(They're chatting in Mandarin.)
How do you know where I'm working, Yue-Yue?
Ah Feng told me.
Ah Feng?
His right hand man?
Yeah.
Oh my gosh!
So he knows where I am now?
That's right, jie-jie.
I thought I could start a new life...
Where have you been until now, jie-jie?
I've been living here after running away.
But why are you here, Yue-Yue?
After you ran away, mother was worried that he would ask me in exchange.
So she sent me to auntie.
I've been living with her since then.
It isn't far from here.
I know.
I chose this city because I thought this would be the last place he would look for me.
But it's not safe here anymore.
What will you do now, jie-jie?
I don't know.
If he knows I'm here, I can't think of a place to hide anymore.
I'm worried.
Don't be, Yue-Yue.
Ah, tell me, how is our mother?
She's fine.
After you ran away, she was sad but she always told me you were brave.
She wished she had run away like you did.
But if she had run away, we wouldn't have been born.
I'm worried, jie-jie.
Don't be, Yue-Yue.
I'll find a way.
Jie-jie...
That night, although she reassured Yue-Yue, Suzie starts to worry.
She left China, hoping to start a new life.
Using a new name, she thought they wouldn't find her.
But now, they know she's here.
Will she be able to run away again?
She doubts that.
She's pretty sure they're watching her at the moment.
But what will she do now?
Will she just let them decide her life like this?
Tomorrow morning.
{i}Another day.{/i}
{i}I really think I should consider starting my own business.{/i}
{i}It's so quiet this morning.{/i}
{i}Just start to work now.{/i}
{i}I'll ask some friends about the idea of starting my own business this weekend.{/i}
Meanwhile, in the office of Woody George.
{i}What can I do now?{/i}
{i}I have no one to ask for help in this situation.{/i}
{i}Wait, should I ask Woody?{/i}
{i}Haven't I accepted to date him already?{/i}
{i}Even if we've just started dating, I think I should ask him.{/i}
{i}At least I can make a choice for my life.{/i}
{i}I can't stop remembering about yesterday.{/i}
{i}What a cute chick!{/i}
{i}Didn't think that she has a cute little sister like that.{/i}
{i}What if I can have them both?{/i}
Mr George.
{i}Imagine both sisters sleep with me at night, hehe.{/i}
Mr George!
Er, what is it, Ms Lee?
Um... I know we're still in the company, but could I... discuss with you about some personal matter, Mr George?
Sure, Ms Lee.
I... as you know... we're... dating now.
I know.
Um... could I... move in with you?
Move in with me?
Wow! I thought you said we wouldn't have sex until marriage?
Of course we won't!
It's just that...
It's just what, Suzie?
I... I don't want to get married.
What?
What are you saying?
Now I'm really confused...
I mean my father arranged my marriage.
But I was against that and ran away from home.
Wow!
Now they've found me.
I... I need to show them that I won't get married with someone I don't love!
Would you please help me?
Um...
{i}This is complicated.{/i}
I... I know I'm stupid to ask you that.
Sorry, I'm going back to my seat.
Sorry, Mr George.
No, don't be.
Let's move in.
I'll show those people what love really is.
Love isn't about arranging marriages for your children!
{i}And it isn't about waiting for marriage either, hehehe.{/i}
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you!
{i}What about [povname]?{/i}
{i}Should I ask him?{/i}
{i}He told me he would discuss with Emily about me.{/i}
{i}But I don't think he discussed with her yet.{/i}
{i}He's the only one can help me now.{/i}
{i}But I think I have to ask Emily first.{/i}
Half an hour later.
What did you call me here for, Suzie?
Emily, may I ask you a favor?
Tell me, what do you want?
I... Could I live at [povname]'s place for a short time?
What? Why?
I need to let some people see that I'm living with a guy and... I can't get married.
What?
But why do you choose [povname]?
Because... he's the only good guy I know.
I... I think he won't harm me when I'm staying at his place.
But what about me?
I know.
That's why I'm asking for your permission first.
Hm...
But why do you need to do that?
I...
My father arranged my marriage.
Afther he died, I ran away.
Now they've found me.
So...
Could I...
I can't answer you now.
Let me think.
I'll answer you later.
Yeah... I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'll give you the answer soon.
That night.
{i}It's hard to believe that there are still arranged marriages.{/i}
{i}But I don't think she lied to me either.{/i}
{i}Should I help her?{/i}
{i}I don't like the idea of letting them staying together at all.{/i}
{i}But...{/i}
{i}Hm... I hope I won't regret this.{/i}
Tomorrow at work.
{i}What's this?{/i}
{i}Emily sent me a text, saying that she accepted what Suzie asked for.{/i}
{i}What's she talking about?{/i}
{i}Hm... another text... from Suzie.{/i}
{i}Meet her at the kitchen area?{/i}
{i}What are these girls doing?{/i}
{i}What about [povname]?{/i}
{i}Should I ask him?{/i}
{i}Haven't I accepted to date him already?{/i}
{i}Even if we've just started dating, I think I should ask him.{/i}
{i}At least I can make a choice for my life.{/i}
{i}A text from Suzie?{/i}
{i}Meet her at the kitchen area?{/i}
{i}What does she want?{/i}
{i}Hmm, where is she?{/i}
{i}Oh, there she is.{/i}
Hi, Suzie.
What do you want to see me for?
I... can I ask you a favor?
What do you want me to do?
I... can I stay at your place for a short time?
What?
Why do you want to stay at my place, Suzie?
I... I want to show some people that I'm... living with a guy.
What's for, Suzie?
I'm confused.
My father arranged my marriage.
What?
After he died, I ran away and came here.
Oh...
But now they've found me.
I want to live with a guy to... show them that I can't get married anymore.
I see...
{i}So this is what Emily accepted.{/i}
{i}Should I accept her request?{/i}
{i}She's cute and I have feeling for her.{/i}
{i}But this situation is... so complicated!{/i}
Um... can I... live with you?
{i}Should I help her?{/i}
Um... Sorry, Suzie.
I think it's... complicated.
I see.
I'm sorry for bothering you about this...
Of course you can.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you!
Now, let's discuss about the date I can pick you up.
{i}Maybe I just... give up and get married?{/i}
That night.
So, what do you want to discuss about, Suzie?
I... I want to move in with a friend.
Move in?
With a girl?
Um... a guy.
Hm?
I thought you were not that kind of girl?
It's not like I want to, Ms Beaumont.
I have to do this because...
Well?
This is my private problem but I always think of you as my big sister so...
So?
I know I'm stupid.
But I don't have a choice.
My father was the Dragon Head of a Triad Cooperation in China.
Whoa...
He arranged for me to get married with another Dragon Head's son of a nearby Triad Cooperation.
He intended to unite 2 gangs into 1 by the marriage.
But he was killed when I was 18.
I took the chance and fled here.
I changed my name to start a new life.
But... they've found me.
Soon, they'll come here to take me back.
I don't wanna get married like that.
So... I think if I live with a guy, they won't force me to come back because they'll think that I'm... not a virgin anymore.
I see...
Well, I don't know what to say...
Um... Thank you, Ms Beaumont, for letting me stay here until now.
It's okay.
I know I'm strict.
But you don't need to call me Ms Beaumont all the time.
If you think of me as your big sister, just call me Dianne.
Yeah. Thank you, Dianne, for all these years.
It's okay.
I hope you'll be fine.
The next Sunday afternoon.
Remember to visit me some times, Suzie.
I'll miss you, Dianne.
Where's your stuff, Suzie?
I don't see any suitcase at all.
I moved them all yesterday.
So, you're the guy, eh?
I met you on the island.
Yeah, I'm the guy.
I'll take her back to visit you some times.
Don't worry.
Take care of her.
My pleasure.
{i}I don't trust this guy at all.{/i}
From now on, this place will be your home, Suzie.
Thank you, Woody.
{i}This place is big and luxurious.{/i}
{i}But it still can't compare to my villa back in China.{/i}
{i}I don't need a luxurious life.{/i}
{i}I just want to live with the guy I love.{/i}
I'm done, Woody.
Would you please show me where I'll sleep, please?
Well, you'll sleep in my bedroom.
I'll sleep here, in the sofa.
Er?
I thought you had a guest room?
I'm sorry.
I only have a single bedroom.
That's not good.
You're the owner of this house.
I can't let you sleep on the sofa.
Well, we don't have another choice though.
If so, I'll sleep here.
No, how can I let a girl like you sleep on a sofa when I'm sleeping in a bed?
Um...
We can sleep together.
But please don't...
Don't worry, Suzie.
I know we won't have sex before marriage.
{i}Not the right time yet.{/i}
Thank you.
Here we are.
Um... Could you... don't turn off the lights when we're sleeping?
Well, if you want then it's okay.
Thanks, Woody.
{i}I feel safer if the lights are on.{/i}
Some hours later.
{i}It's hard to sleep than I thought.{/i}
{i}Her scent is so intoxicating.{/i}
{i}I just want to fuck her right away!{/i}
{i}Well, it's not the right time yet.{/i}
{i}I'll try to sleep then.{/i}
{i}One sheep.{/i}
{i}Two sheep.{/i}
{i}Three sheep.{/i}
{i}Four neep.{/i}
{i}Five neep.{/i}
{i}Six nip.{/i}
{i}Seven nipple.{/i}
{i}Shit!{/i}
{i}I really can't stop thinking about sex!{/i}
Tomorrow night.
I still don't understand why there's an arranged marriage.
It's weird even in China.
You're right.
But my family is... not a normal family.
My father was the Dragon Head of a Triad Cooperation.
He arranged for me to marry the son of the Dragon Head of a nearby Triad Cooperation.
He wanted to unite them into one big Cooperation.
What is the Dragon Head of a Triad Cooperation, Suzie?
It's like the boss of a Mafia gang.
I see.
I was so scared of him so I didn't oppose.
But when I was 18, he was murdered.
Well, sorry.
It's okay.
I took the chance and ran away when people were so busy at his funeral.
My real name is Li Qiu-Shui.
Qiu-Shui means Autumn Water and it's also a way to describe beautiful eyes of a woman.
It's a nice name, Suzie.
Thank you.
I changed it into Suzie Lee to start a new life.
And now they've found you?
I thought they wouldn't look at this place because my aunt is living not far from here.
I thought if they didn't see me staying with my aunt, they would think that I fled to a place far from here.
I didn't contact her but they still found me after 3 years.
Who are they?
My fiance's men.
The son of the other Dragon Head?
Yeah.
Hmm...
That's why I need your help, Woody.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure you'll be fine.
Thank you.
Later that night.
Since Woody couldn't sleep last night, he's too tired and is sleeping soundly now.
{i}Hmm... a woman's scent...{/i}
{i}Hmm?{/i}
{i}It's Suzie.{/i}
{i}Has she slept yet?{/i}
{i}Her scent makes me too horny...{/i}
{i}Should I touch her?{/i}
{i}Let see if she's asleep yet or not.{/i}
Er?
{i}Mother F...{/i}
{i}She's still awake!{/i}
{i}I'll pretend that I'm just doing this in my sleep.{/i}
Zzzz... (Snoring)
{i}It seems that he just did it in his dream.{/i}
{i}Safe!{/i}
Some days later, Suzie's starting to fit into her new home.
This novel is fun!
I'll ask Woody if he has more novels like this one!
Yeah, it's me, [povname].
{i}The guy sure looks a lot like Dick.{/i}
{i}I still haven't given Dick enough money yet.{/i}
Take care of her.
And who will take care of me?
I think he's saying that you should stay back, Suzie.
Er?
Hey, I was just joking!
When they come to [povname]'s home.
Oh my...
Why are you here, Emily?
What have you just said?
I can't be here, eh?
No, I didn't mean that!
I'm your girlfriend!
I can come here anytime I want!
Relax, Emily!
{i}I should have thought about this!{/i}
{i}No way she would accept to let me live alone with Suzie!{/i}
Don't be scared, Suzie.
I always treat him like that.
{i}She's right.{/i}
We should show them who's the boss in love.
What?
Hey, that's too far, Emily.
None of your business.
This is my conversation with Suzie.
{i}But this is my place after all...{/i}
Well, let me show you the bathroom.
Thank you, Emily.
{i}Is this still my place or it belongs to Emily now?{/i}
{i}Emily looks so angry.{/i}
{i}I'm worried that she doesn't like me anymore.{/i}
I'm done, [povname].
Okay, it's my time to have a shower now.
{i}I hope she doesn't think this place is too dirty for her.{/i}
I'm worried that you won't have a good sleep.
No more discussion, Suzie.
I'm having a shower now.
What did you two discuss about just now?
I told her that I would sleep on the sofa but she said all three of us would sleep together in bed.
But...
Don't worry.
I bought a new bed right after you asked to live here.
It's big enough for all three of us.
If you said so...
{i}Maybe I was too angry.{/i}
{i}But I had to protect him from her.{/i}
{i}Who wants to let another girl take her man away?{/i}
Oh my gosh, Emily!
I've never seen you dressed like this before!
{i}She's so... gorgeous!{/i}
{i}I think he likes her sexy style more than my style.{/i}
Don't make a big fuss about this.
I've just bought a new pajama, that's all.
{i}You can't win, Suzie!{/i}
{i}Hehehe...{/i}
{i}My bed is right under the window and is full of moonlight.{/i}
{i}Don't know why Suzie kept saying about how she liked the moonlight when she's facing the dark side to sleep.{/i}
{i}Is she trying to make fun of me?{/i}
{i}How can I hug him when it's not dark like this?{/i}
{i}Even though Emily's here, I'm a little bit worried.{/i}
{i}I guess everything will be fine if we sleep under the moonlight like this.{/i}
Tomorrow morning.
Hey, faster, boy.
Why do you always make the ladies wait for you?
{i}Yeah, maybe because I was the last one to use the bathroom?{/i}
At night.
I still don't understand why there's an arranged marriage.
I think it's outdated even in China, right?
You're right.
But my family is... not a normal family.
My father was the Dragon Head of a Triad Cooperation.
He arranged for me to marry the son of the Dragon Head of a nearby Triad Cooperation.
He wanted to unite them into one big Cooperation.
What is the Dragon Head of a Triad Cooperation, Suzie?
It's like the boss of a Mafia gang.
I see.
I was so scared of him so I didn't oppose.
But when I was 18, he was murdered.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's okay.
I took the chance and ran away when people were so busy at his funeral.
My real name is Li Qiu-Shui.
Qiu-Shui means Autumn Water and it's also a way to describe beautiful eyes of a woman.
Wow, your name is very nice.
Thank you.
I changed it into Suzie Lee to start a new life.
And now they've found you?
I thought they wouldn't look at this place because my aunt is living not far from here.
I thought if they didn't see me staying with my aunt, they would think that I fled to a place far from here.
I didn't contact her but they still found me after 3 years.
The people you're saying are...
My fiance's men.
The son of the other Dragon Head?
Yeah.
It's so hard for you.
That's why I need [povname]... I mean I need your help and [povname]'s help now.
Don't worry.
We'll make sure you'll be fine.
Thank you.
{i}They've been talking to each other without caring that I'm still here and now she said on behalf of me.{/i}
{i}I'm starting to wonder if this is still my house or not.{/i}
Later that night.
{i}I can't sleep at all!{/i}
{i}I'm too horny around this time of a month.{/i}
{i}Now I'm lying next to my boyfriend but I can't do anything!{/i}
{i}Or can I?{/i}
{i}Suzie's fast asleep anyway.{/i}
Hey, [povname], wake up!
What is it, Emily?
You can't sleep?
Keep your voice down!
Don't wake her up!
I just want to have some fun, hehe.
{i}Yeah, it's near the time of her period.{/i}
{i}Usually she would jump on my dick until she couldn't ride it anymore.{/i}
{i}But we have Suzie here.{/i}
{i}Can't believe she wants to do that.{/i}
We don't have another room.
Let's do this right here!
{i}Will I do this with the risk of waking Suzie up?{/i}
But let's be quiet.
Don't worry.
I don't want to wake her up either.
Er, you guys are still awake?
Oh my gosh...
Er, you haven't slept yet?
I didn't see anything.
Don't worry.
Just... keep doing it.
We didn't do anything!
I was just... massaging his shoulders.
Yeah.
My shoulders were stiff so...
Please don't worry about me.
You can keep... massaging each other without me.
{i}Is it just me or she sounds jealous?{/i}
I'm done now!
Go back to sleep, [povname]!
{i}It was close.{/i}
{i}I'm still trembling now.{/i}
{i}I was just starting though.{/i}
{i}What if she woke up when I was riding [povname]'s cock?{/i}
{i}Thinking about that makes me more horny!{/i}
{i}Stupid, Emily!{/i}
{i}Get back to sleep!{/i}
No, Emily.
Suzie's right here.
Let's wait for a chance when she goes out.
{i}How could he do this to me?{/i}
Some days later, Suzie's starting to fit into her new home.
This novel is fun, [povname]!
{i}Yeah, after work, she'll clean the place and read some books like a wife.{/i}
{i}When my so-called girlfriend is always...{/i}
What are you standing there for?
{i}... acting like my boss...{/i}
Get me a can of orange juice!
Here we are, my humble room.
It's very small so...
Please don't worry, [povname].
This is all I need.
Well, let me show you the bathroom.
Thanks, [povname].
{i}His place is small.{/i}
{i}It'll be inconvenient for me to change clothes.{/i}
I'm done, [povname].
Okay, it's my time to have a shower now.
{i}I hope she doesn't think this place is too dirty for her.{/i}
I think I should sleep on the sofa, [povname].
Don't worry.
I bought a new bed right after you asked to live here.
It's very big.
If you said so...
{i}My bed is right under the window and is full of moonlight.{/i}
{i}Don't know why Suzie kept saying about how she liked the moonlight when she's facing the dark side to sleep.{/i}
{i}Is she worried that I will molest her at night?{/i}
{i}I'm a little bit worried.{/i}
{i}I guess everything will be fine if we sleep under the moonlight like this.{/i}
Tomorrow morning.
Sorry to use the bathroom before you, [povname].
Lady first, don't worry, Suzie.
At night.
I still don't understand why there's an arranged marriage.
I think it's outdated even in China, right?
You're right.
But my family is... not a normal family.

My real name is Li Qiu-Shui.
Qiu-Shui means Autumn Water and it's also a way to describe beautiful eyes of a woman.
Your name is very nice.
{i}Only that I couldn't repeat the name.{/i}
Thank you.
I changed it into Suzie Lee to start a new life.

I thought they wouldn't look at this place because my aunt is living not far from here.

Yeah.
It's so hard for you.
That's why I need your help now, [povname].
Don't worry.
I'll make sure you'll be fine.
Thank you, [povname].
Later that night.
{i}What is this scent?{/i}
{i}Hm...{/i}
{i}It seems that I rolled over to her place in my sleep.{/i}
{i}Her scent is so nice though.{/i}
{i}I really want to kiss her neck.{/i}
{i}But it won't be good if she wakes up.{/i}
{i}Should I touch her shoulder to see if she's awake or not?{/i}
{i}If she's still awake, I'll pretend that I touch her in my sleep.{/i}
{i}Should I touch her?{/i}
{i}Let me see if she's still awake or not.{/i}
Er?
{i}Shit!{/i}
Zzzzz... (Snoring)
{i}It seems that he only touched me in his sleep.{/i}
{i}I think she believes that I'm sleeping now.{/i}
{i}That was close!{/i}
{i}No, I shouldn't.{/i}
{i}I should go back to sleep now.{/i}
Some days later, Suzie's starting to fit into her new home.
This novel is fun, [povname]!
{i}Yeah, after work, she'll clean the place and read some books like a wife.{/i}
{i}She's so cute...{/i}
Everything's fine until Friday night...
Why do you want to have a dinner with us, Mrs Park?
Well, I usually hang out with... some friends at a bar.
{i}Hot guys only.{/i}
But now I can't anymore.
{i}I miss the way they touch me...{/i}
All thanks to someone who follows me all the time.
{i}I'm only doing my job.{/i}
{i}But why can't you hang out at a bar anymore?{/i}
I heard Dianne said that you couldn't drink, right?
That's right, Mrs Park.
I can't drink.
That's not fun at all!
You should drink with us!
We're only women!
No one will touch you or anything!
Er...
But I'm worried that I'll pass out so...
{i}Yeah, it'll be trouble if she passes out.{/i}
{i}Oh wait!{/i}
{i}This might be a good chance to be alone with [povname] tonight!{/i}
{i}Yeah, it'll be trouble if she passes out.{/i}
{i}But we shouldn't upset Mrs Park either.{/i}
Don't worry, Suzie.
We'll call a taxi for you.
That's right.
Don't worry.
I know where you live.
Dianne is my cousin after all.
My driver will take you home safe and sound.
You don't need to.
I'll call a taxi for myself.
Um... Alright, I'll drink.
But just a little...
That's great!
Bring us the menu, please!
{i}They don't know that I'm staying at Woody's place now.{/i}
{i}But he doesn't do anything to me for a whole week.{/i}
{i}I think I'll be fine.{/i}
Some hours later.
{i}Finally, I'm home.{/i}
Ugh...
{i}The door...{/i}
{i}Ah... My head is spinning around...{/i}
{i}I'm here finally...{/i}
Ugh...
Some minutes later.
Oh... shit...
{i}She smells like alcohol.{/i}
{i}She's drunk for sure.{/i}
Hmm...
I can't let you sleep like this, Suzie.
I'll help you change into your pajama.
Some minutes later.
Um...
{i}Where is this place?{/i}
{i}Why do I feel tickled down there?{/i}
Woody?
Oh...
{i}He's sucking my vagina...{/i}
{i}It's... dirty!{/i}
{i}But what is this feeling?{/i}
Um...
Woody... be patient...
We'll continue this on our wedding night...
Silent, Suzie.
Er?
You don't know what you're saying.
Let me show you what you really need.
I'm sure you'll thank me later.
Er?
Here we go.
Er?
Ah... I'm hurt... Woody!
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.
Ugh... so tight...
Ah...
Virgin is the best... Ugh...
Ah... gentle, please...
Ah...
Do you feel good, Suzie?
No... it's just... I'm so hurt... Ah...
Don't worry... you'll be fine...
You'll feel good next time...
Um...
You're so tight, Suzie... oh...
Mm... mm...
I love you, Suzie.
Finish it... please...
Oh... so tight!
Um...
A virgin pussy is so tight... oh...
Mm...
I can't hold it anymore...
Um...
Here I come, Suzie...
Ugh...
Oh... oh... receive my seeds, Suzie...
Ugh...
Um...
You're a woman now, my woman.
{i}I'm still hurt...{/i}
{i}They don't know that I'm staying at [povname]'s place now.{/i}
{i}But Emily also lives with us.{/i}
{i}I think I'll be fine.{/i}
Some hours later, you come home after a tough dealing with a customer.
{i}Why do I have to work until this hour?{/i}
{i}I really have to change my job!{/i}
Emily?
Why are you naked like this, Emily?
I... hic... want to... hic... have a moon-tanned skin... hic...
{i}She's drunk.{/i}
Where did you drink, Emily?
Who told you that I went out drinking?
Did you hire a detective to follow me, you jerk?
You're drunk.
Let's go to sleep, Emily.
Does the detective tell you that I'm too horny now, eh, bad boy?
{i}She's drunk now.{/i}
{i}But I'm too horny also.{/i}
{i}She's been here with Suzie for a whole week and I couldn't even masturbate!{/i}
{i}Should I have fun with her now?{/i}
I'm going in now, Emily.
Hic...
Oh...
Oh...
So good... Hic...
You're so tight tonight, Emily.
Really? Hic...
I thought your cock is bigger than usual tonight... hic...
Oh... oh...
{i}Yeah. Maybe because Suzie's also here...{/i}
Oh... fuck me faster... [povname]... oh...
Oh... oh...
Faster... faster...
Not so loud, Emily!
You might wake Suzie up!
I don't care... faster... hic...
If she's awake now, we'll fuck her... oh... oh...
Really?
Yeah... I'll make her suck my pussy when you're fucking her like crazy... hic... oh...
{i}Shit! Imagining what she says is too much for me...{/i}
I'm gonna come now, Emily...
Give it to me... oh... oh...
Oh...
Ugh...
{i}Did she really think I would suck... that thing of her?{/i}
{i}So gross!{/i}
You're drunk.
Let's go to sleep, Emily.
Hic...
{i}They don't know that I'm staying at [povname]'s place now.{/i}
{i}But he doesn't do anything to me for a whole week.{/i}
{i}I think I'll be fine.{/i}
Some hours later.
Ah... My head is spinning around...
Some minutes later.
Hm?
{i}She smells like alcohol.{/i}
{i}She's drunk!{/i}
{i}I can't let her sleep like this.{/i}
{i}But changing her clothes is...{/i}
{i}Well, what should I do now?{/i}
Well, good night, Suzie.
{i}I'll help her change into her pajama.{/i}
Some minutes later.
Um...
{i}Shit, I thought I would only change her clothes.{/i}
{i}Where is this place?{/i}
{i}But I couldn't stop myself from touching her!{/i}
{i}Why do I feel tickled down there?{/i}
[povname]?
Oh...
{i}He's sucking my vagina...{/i}
{i}It's... dirty!{/i}
{i}But what is this feeling?{/i}
Um...
[povname]... be patient...
We'll continue this on our wedding night...
{i}But I'm too horny now!{/i}
{i}She doesn't stop me either!{/i}
{i}Should I keep going or stop here?{/i}
You're right.
We'll continue this after we get married then.
Thanks, [povname].
Don't worry, Suzie.
I'll be gentle.
Er?
I'm going in now.
Er?
Ah... I'm hurt... [povname]!
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.
Ugh... so tight...
Ah...
I took your virgin, Suzie... Ugh...
Ah... Gentle, please...
Ah...
Do you feel good, Suzie?
No... it's just... I'm so hurt... Ah...
Don't worry...
Ah...
You'll feel good next time...
Mm... mm...
I love you, Suzie...
Finish it... please...
Ugh... I can't hold it anymore...
Here I come, Suzie...
Ugh...
Oh... oh... I'm coming, Suzie...
Ugh...
Um...
It was our first time so I couldn't hold it longer.
I'll make you feel good next time, Suzie.
{i}I'm still hurt...{/i}
In China.
Is everything ready? (Speaking in Mandarin)
Good. I'm on my way now. (Speaking in Mandarin)
Tomorrow.
{i}He didn't keep his promise.{/i}
{i}How can I trust him for the rest of my life?{/i}
{i}He doesn't love me.{/i}
{i}He just wants to have sex with me.{/i}
{i}What's the difference then?{/i}
{i}I'm tired of running.{/i}
{i}Three years has passed...{/i}
{i}I didn't think I would make this call.{/i}
Ah Feng, it's me, Qiu-Shui. (Speaking in Mandarin.)
I'll send you the address, tell him to pick me up. (Speaking in Mandarin.)
Okay. (Speaking in Mandarin.)
{i}Goodbye, [povname].{/i}
{i}I'll miss you.{/i}
On Monday.
{i}Why didn't she answer the phone?{/i}
{i}After I went home, all of her clothes disappeared.{/i}
{i}I asked Ms Beaumont but she didn't know anything.{/i}
{i}Where could she be?{/i}
{i}Is she still upset about that night?{/i}
Tomorrow.
{i}He didn't keep his promise.{/i}
{i}How can I trust him for the rest of my life?{/i}
{i}He doesn't love me.{/i}
{i}He just wants to have sex with me.{/i}
{i}What's the difference then?{/i}
{i}I'm tired of running.{/i}
{i}Three years has passed...{/i}
{i}I didn't think I would make this call.{/i}
Ah Feng, it's me, Qiu-Shui. (Speaking in Mandarin.)
I'll send you the address, tell him to pick me up. (Speaking in Mandarin.)
Okay. (Speaking in Mandarin.)
{i}Goodbye, Woody.{/i}
{i}I'll miss you.{/i}
When you start a new week.
{i}An information about changing staff?{/i}
{i}What?{/i}
{i}Suzie resigned and went back to China?{/i}
Some months later, in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China.
(From now on, Suzie and her fiance speak in Mandarin only.)
Please go outside!
I have to sleep!
And I have to fuck!
But we haven't got married yet!
Can't you just wait for another week?
Why?
We're engaged!
I know, but...
At least give me a handjob!
Handjob?
You mean I use my hand to...
Of course, is there another type of handjob?
Uhm...
Please go outside after I finish it.
Can't I just sleep here with you?
I want to be alone until I'm your wife.
Hmm... Okay.
{i}This is the thing will take my virginity.{/i}
What are you waiting for?
Start using your hand!
{i}What the fuck is this?{/i}
{i}I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it.{/i}
{i}What is she doing?{/i}
{i}I'm not experienced in these things.{/i}
{i}I can't feel a damn thing!{/i}
{i}I hope he'll finish it soon.{/i}
{i}She's not good at all!{/i}
{i}I'm sleepy.{/i}
Hey, do you know how to do it?
Er, what do you mean?
Do you know how to give a handjob?
I'm not experienced in this.
How can I come like this?
I'm even better than you!
If I did it myself, I had come already!
How about you go outside and do it yourself?
I think that'll be better for both of us.
What?
Eh?
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you!
You're my wife!
You have to please me not to mock me!
I'm sorry but I didn't mean to mock you!
Hey! No!
I don't want it!
Silent!
No...
Sooner or later, you'll have to give it to me!
I know, but...
Ah!
Oh... so tight...
Mmm... mm... mm...
I've never fucked a pussy as tight as yours... oh...
Don't... mmm... say that to me... mmm...
Why? You're my woman!
Even so... I want you to respect... mmm... me...
What the fuck?
Mmm...
You only have one job to do: spread your legs!
Mmm...
Why the fuck should I have to respect you?
Mmm... half of the new corporation is mine... mmm...
Don't forget... that... mmm...
Shit!
So what?
Ah...
Do you want to betray me?
No... mmm...
Slow down... mmm...
Why?
I'm hurt...
I don't care!
Mmm...
Don't forget that we know where Yue-Yue is!
No! Don't touch her!
Then don't betray me!
Ah... Ah...
Shit... I'm coming... Oh...
Outside, please...
The fuck?
I'm your husband!
Oh...
I don't wanna get pregnant... mmm... yet...
Ah...
Mmm...
I'll fuck you again after some minutes. Hahaha...
You're not a virgin?
What the fuck?
Who fucked you before me?
Answer me!
Hey, are you deaf?
Fuck!
15 minutes later.
Someone else fucked me before you.
So what?
What the fuck with your attitude?
You have the right to fuck anyone you want before our wedding, but I don't?
What the fuck?
I'm a man!
And?
If you don't want to be cuckolded, behave yourself.
What? Fuck you!
You're my woman now, Qiu-Shui.
Hey, get up and clean yourself before I continue to fuck you again!
Just once is not enough for me!
Hey, are you deaf?
Fuck!
4 years later.
The water is so cool!
Why don't you join me, jie-jie?
{i}I knew long ago that I would end up becoming a widow just like my mother.{/i}
{i}But he couldn't have children.{/i}
{i}Maybe I'm lucky.{/i}
{i}I don't want to have children with someone I don't love.{/i}
{i}4 years already.{/i}
{i}On this day 4 years ago, I had a plane crash with everyone.{/i}
{i}How are they now?{/i}
{i}Should I come back to visit them?{/i}
Meanwhile.
{i}This is where I was stuck with everyone 4 years ago.{/i}
{i}You may wonder why I'm here.{/i}
{i}Well, how can I say it?{/i}
{i}Only after Suzie left, I knew how much I had been in love with her.{/i}
{i}I contacted many people, but it turned out that all of her information was fake.{/i}
{i}They all told me that she always said she was from Wuxi.{/i}
{i}So I went there to look for her.{/i}
{i}But no one I met in China knew about her.{/i}
{i}I'm not sure if she'll ever come here or not.{/i}
{i}But every year, I come here on the day that we had the plane crash 4 years ago.{/i}
{i}I just hope that she'll come here once.{/i}
{i}Maybe I can meet her again.{/i}
{i}I just want to tell her that I really love her...{/i}
Meanwhile.
{i}You may wonder why I'm here.{/i}
{i}Well, how can I say it?{/i}
{i}Emily finally became my wife.{/i}
{i}For our honeymoon, she wanted to come here, where we were stuck on the company vacation 4 years ago.{/i}
{i}This place isn't an isolated island anymore.{/i}
{i}But not many people know about this shore.{/i}
{i}Yup, 4 years has passed.{/i}
{i}We're still in love.{/i}
{i}But I feel something inside me is missing.{/i}
{i}What is it?{/i}
{i}Isn't Emily my wife now?{/i}
{i}Who am I missing?{/i}
On Sunday.
Knock knock.
Let me answer the door.
{i}She's so sweet.{/i}
{i}She's doing the chores like a wife.{/i}
{i}What if we get married?{/i}
{i}Will she still be just like this?{/i}
{i}Some people change after they get married.{/i}
Qiu-Shui.
Ah Qing!?
{i}Who's that?{/i}
I guess you're the owner of this house?
I'm just a tenant.
If you want, I'll show you the way to the landlady's room.
No need.
I'm here to take Qiu-Shui back.
You mean Suzie?
No!
I won't go with you!
Playtime is over, Qiu-Shui.
I won't go with you, please go back!
I know you're angry with your father.
But we're engaged after all.
I don't want my life to be arranged by anyone!
Why are you so stubborn like this?
Because I don't want to live a life that I have to be worried for my husband all the time like my mother.
Don't you know why my father died?
Don't you know how my mother felt at that time?
I don't want to live a life like my mother!
Alright, alright!
I'll resign from the corporation.
Too late, Ah Qing.
I'm in love with [povname] now.
This guy?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
I'll give him some money as a compensation.
What the fuck?
You can't!
I... I'm having his child!
What?
Quiet, [povname]!
Let me deal with him!
No! Let him deal with my gun!
Hey hey hey!
Fuck you, how dare you touch my woman!
I'm not yours!
If you want to kill him, kill me also!
Suzie...
Why are you doing this to me, Qiu-Shui!
If you truly love me, please go back, Ah Qing!
What's done is done!
I can't go back with you anymore!
Why, Qiu-shui?
Please go.
Aren't you worried that I'll send assassins to kill him when you're not around?
If you do that, I'll commit suicide!
Without him, I don't wanna live anymore!
Suzie...
Alright, I'll go back.
But just for now.
Leave the corporation, Ah Qing.
Don't let your wife live a life like my mother.
Goodbye, Qiu-shui.
Are you okay, Suzie?
I'm fine.
Are you crying?
I'm scared!
Don't worry, Suzie.
He's gone.
What if he comes back?
I'll protect you.
Even if that's the last thing I can do.
Don't be!
I want you to stay with me for the rest of my life, [povname]!
We'll be together until the end.
Promise me, you'll never leave me.
I'll never leave you, Suzie.
But what about Emily?
Well...
{i}Yeah, what about her?{/i}
I want to know your final decision, [povname].
Who do you choose, me or Emily?
Well...
{i}How should I answer her?{/i}
I'm sorry.
I can't betray Emily.
Okay, I get it.
I'm sorry, Suzie.
Don't be.
I'll always pray for you.
And so, Suzie left.
No one knows where she went.
Maybe she went back home.
Or maybe she moved to another city.
We don't know.
[povname] continues his life with Emily.
Does he regret that he let Suzie go?
Or I have to say, as [povname], do you regret?
I love you but I can't betray Emily.
I want to live with both of you.
I understand.
It's fine for me to live together with her.
But what about her?
Listen to me, Suzie.
We shouldn't tell Emily about that guy just now.
I don't want to make her worrry.
I'll just tell her my decision that I want to live with both of you.
If she denies, we'll leave her.
Okay, we'll do as you say.
Later.
So, at first she told me that she needed a place to hide from some bad guys.
And just 5 seconds ago, you explained to me that she lied because she loved you and you two wanted to live together.
Well, together with me.
Two women with one man.
That's called polygamy, am I right?
Yes, you're right.
Are you two taking me for a fool?
No, we're not.
I'm sorry if our request offended you.
But we're not taking you for a fool.
Hmm, okay.
I'll think about that and will give you my answer soon.
But for now, please behave yourself.
Please respect me and don't hug, kiss or do anything before my eyes or even behind my back.
Okay.
I won't, Emily.
Okay, I'll go to sleep now.
I'll do some chores then.
Tomorrow, at work.
{i}I can't do a damn thing at all!{/i}
{i}What the fuck is she thinking?{/i}
{i}Does she think that she can steal my man just like that?{/i}
{i}Fuck her!{/i}
{i}No one can steal anything from me!{/i}
{i}I'm not my mother!{/i}
{i}I won't run away like her!{/i}
{i}I'll fight to get back what belongs to me!{/i}
{i}Hmm... [povname] said he would have a drink with his customer and would get home so late.{/i}
{i}I had to get that chance to come home to get some clothes.{/i}
{i}Can't leave them alone at all!{/i}
{i}Unfortunately I got into a terrible traffic.{/i}
{i}But I guess he hasn't got home yet.{/i}
{i}Hmm... the light is off?{/i}
{i}Well, well, well, what do we have here?{/i}
{i}A sleeping beauty under the full moon.{/i}
{i}Hmm... I'm still wondering what does she has that [povname] wants her.{/i}
{i}Aren't my breast bigger?{/i}
{i}They told me they hadn't fucked yet.{/i}
{i}I think they didn't lie to me.{/i}
{i}People say Asian girls are very strict.{/i}
{i}They won't let the guys have sex so soon in a relationship like us.{/i}
{i}So it can't be because her pussy is better.{/i}
{i}Hmm...{/i}
{i}Only one way to know!{/i}
{i}I've never done this with a woman before.{/i}
{i}You're lucky to be my first woman, Suzie.{/i}
{i}Hmm... Nice tits.{/i}
{i}Let's see what you have down here, too.{/i}
{i}Only the panty left.{/i}
Eh?
What are you doing, Emily?
Quiet!
If you want to live with me and [povname], you'll have to obey me!
What do you mean?
Do you want to live with me and [povname]?
I do, but?
If you live with us, you'll have to have sex with me also!
I'm not a lesbian!
Who cares?
If you want to live with us, you'll have to listen to me!
But...
10 minutes later.
Mm...
What the fuck?
Oh...
What's going on here?
Ah!
We're fucking.
What?
Why are you so surprised?
Don't you want the three of us to live together?
But...
Stop saying but!
Undress and climb on top of me!
Hm...
What now then?
Fuck me.
Hmm?
Fuck me only.
And don't you dare fuck her!
I won't allow that yet!
{i}What is this?{/i}
{i}She's demanding me now?{/i}
{i}If I let this go on, I'll become her puppet!{/i}
{i}But I've just told her about Suzie.{/i}
{i}Maybe I'll let her control me this time.{/i}
{i}I'll change her attitude later.{/i}
What are you waiting for?
If you don't fuck me now, I'll get out to buy a strap-on to take her virginity!
No, don't, Emily!
{i}Shit!{/i}
{i}Should I obey and fuck her or fuck Suzie to show her who's the boss here?{/i}
No!
You're not the boss here!
I'll fuck anyone I want!
I'll fuck Suzie now!
No! Don't!
Ouch!
You're angry?
You have no right to get angry!
I'm the one who has to suffer here!
Fuck you!
Fuck you all!
All men are the same!
You're just like my father!
Cheater!
Don't ever think about me anymore!
You're out of my life!
{i}Suzie's pussy is so inviting.{/i}
{i}But I have to fuck Emily now.{/i}
{i}Shit!{/i}
I'm going in now!
Oh...
Yeah!... oh...
Fuck me... fuck me...
Mm...
Oh... yeah...
Ah... oh...
{i}Shit!{/i}
Mm...
Oh...
{i}[povname] is grunting even though he was angry just some minutes ago.{/i}
{i}I guess he likes her vagina.{/i}
Oh... yeah...
Mm...
{i}He isn't making love with me but her body is caressing me down there.{/i}
Oh... oh...
{i}I'm starting to feel aroused also...{/i}
Mm...
Oh... so good...
Mm...
You're so good at this, [povname]... oh...
Now, faster...
Mm...
Fuck me faster! Oh...
Oh... yeah...
Good... good...
Mm...
Fuck me... fuck me...
Ah... I can't hold it anymore, Emily...
Mm...
Come... come for me... oh...
Shit... I'm coming...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
I can feel it, Suzie...
Mm?
I can feel he's coming inside me...
Mm... yeah...
Don't worry, Suzie.
I'll buy a strap-on soon.
I'll be the first one to take you to heaven.
Mm... I don't want to have sex yet, Emily.
{i}Fuck!{/i}
{i}I really can't let it go on like this!{/i}
Some days later.
What do you call me here for, Mr George?
I guess you know that Emily and Suzie is staying with [povname] now.
Yes, I know.
Don't you want to do anything?
Like what?
Help me separate them.
Why?
{i}He wants me to be his puppet just like before at his birthday party.{/i}
Don't you love Emily?
And?
Separate them.
You'll get Emily.
I'll get Suzie.
Hm...
I'll think about that.
{i}He thinks I'm dumb?{/i}
2 months later.
Mm...
{i}Where am I?{/i}
Eh? Where are my clothes?
Let's run away, Suzie.
What do you mean, [povname]?
We'll go to a place far from here.
We'll start a new life, with just the two of us.
Won't you be sad to leave your hometown and friends behind?
As long as I'm with you, wherever we go is my hometown.
And you're worth more than a million friends.
No, a billion friends!
[povname]...
And so, they left to start a new life.
In case you happen to be a friend of Ximen Qing (or maybe he plays this game), I can't tell you their whereabout.
I can only tell you that, 4 years after they left, if you went to a certain beach, you might see them there.
No one's there to witness their wedding.
But who cares?
What they want is just a peaceful life for the two of them.
And they have each other.
Who needs another guy or girl to disturb their happiness?
Aren't you sad that no one's here to bless us, Suzie?
Why?
Aren't we what's blessing for each other?
You're right, Suzie.
4 years later.
[povname], do you take Suzie to be your wedded wife, to live together in marriage?
Do you promise to love her, comfort her, honor and keep her for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, and forsaking all others, be faithful only to her, for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Suzie, do you take [povname] to be your wedded husband to live together in marriage?
Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health and forsaking all others, be faithful only to him so long as you both shall live?
I do.
Meanwhile, at the other side of the pavillion.
So, why don't you become a witness of their wedding after coming all the way here?
I'm just here to protect you.
That's my job.
No need to hide that.
I know you've been in love with him for a long time.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay!
Not fun at all.
I'm swimming now.
Remember to protect me!
'cause that your job, haha...
That night.
Are you tired, Suzie?
Just a little, [povname].
This is our first night as husband and wife, Suzie.
Yeah, [povname].
{i}Yes, this is really the first night.{/i}
{i}She said she wanted to keep her virginity until marriage.{/i}
{i}So I could only kiss, caress her.{/i}
{i}Yup, 4 years already.{/i}
{i}She always says love is patience.{/i}
Let's go to sleep, [povname].
{i}The fuck?{/i}
{i}Even on our first night, she just wants to sleep?{/i}
{i}Well, maybe she's tired.{/i}
{i}Let's do that later.{/i}
{i}I've been waiting for 4 years.{/i}
{i}Just another night.{/i}
Good night, Suzie.
Good night, [povname].
{i}No, no, no, no!{/i}
{i}I've been waiting for 4 years!{/i}
Suzie, I know you're tired.
But you know, this is my first night with you, so...
I understand, [povname].
Just please be gentle.
This is my first night and I'm tired.
Yeah, don't worry.
Would you please close your eyes, [povname]?
Uhm, okay.
Are you done, Suzie?
I'm done.
You could open your eyes now.
{i}She's still shy.{/i}
{i}Let's dig in!{/i}
Eh?
Please be gentle, [povname]!
Don't worry, Suzie.
Please be gentle, I'm scared!
Don't worry.
I'll be very gentle!
{i}Let's begin with her nipple.{/i}
{i}She smells so good!{/i}
Mm...
Mm...
Oh...
Oh...
Please remember to be gentle when you go in, [povname]!
Don't worry, Suzie.
No!
Don't look too close!
Eh?
Mm...
No, it's dirty!
Mm...
Oh...
{i}I've never felt like this when I touched myself alone!{/i}
Mm...
Oh...
[povname]...
{i}He stopped...{/i}
Eh?
Wait!
Ah!
It won't fit!
Don't worry.
Please stop!
You'll feel good soon, Suzie.
No!
I don't want it anymore!
Please stop!
Ah!!!
It's fine now, Suzie.
No! You liar!
You said you would be gentle!
You'll feel good soon, Suzie.
Ugh... ugh... ugh...
Are you still hurt, Suzie?
I'm... ugh... still hurt... ugh...
I'll be gentle, don't worry.
You liar... ugh...
You're so tight, Suzie... oh...
I've... never... ugh... done this... before... ugh...
Are you still hurt?
It's better now... mm...
Do you start to feel good?
Mm... mm...
Do you feel good, Suzie?
Mm... don't ask me... mm...
{i}It seems that she starts to feel good.{/i}
Mm... mm...
{i}It's time for me to enjoy now.{/i}
Oh... oh...
Don't... be too rough..., [povname]...
Mm... mm...
Oh... oh...
You liar... oh...
You're... mm... not gentle... ah...
I can't hold it anymore... oh...
Mm... mm...
You're too tight!
I'm coming, Suzie!
Ugh... ugh...
I'm coming...
Oh... oh...
Oh...
Ugh...
Mm...
Lie down with me, please...
Don't ever leave me, [povname]...
I'll never leave you, Suzie.
One year later.
What did the doctor say, Suzie?
Everything's fine.
Our baby is healthy.
Do you think of a name for her yet?
I'm not good at choosing.
Yeah, you always say that.
But why do you think our child will be a girl, [povname]?
Well, I don't know.
I just think so.
Ah, so Yue-Yue will start to live with us next week?
Uhm, I need someone to look after me when I'm going to give birth.
Well, I'm not sure about that.
She's too young.
Hey, don't ever think about any pervert stuff with her, okay?
Why should I think about anything with her?
Who knows?
They say men are beasts inside.
Not me, I'm a gentleman.
No, you're a liar.
Again.
You keep calling me liar after our first night.
Ah, Yue-Yue told me that Ah Qing was murdered!
Your ex-fiance in China?
Yeah.
Who killed him?
I don't know.
My father was murdered also.
I didn't want to be a widow like my mother.
That's why I ran away.
You have me now.
Don't worry, Suzie.
Yeah.
I have you now.
This is the end of The Engagement.
After The Engagement, I'll start Jealousy.
Jealousy is the sequel of The Engagement.
Jealousy takes place 2 months after the Harem Ending of The Engagement.
[povname] starts his own business with Emily and Suzie.
They are now the rival of Rhys Park and Woody George.
Yue-Yue also lives with them.
She's a college freshman and is working at Corsica, the ice-cream parlor of Dianne.
They don’t tell her the fact that Suzie's in a complicated relationship with [povname] and Emily.
That makes her suspect that her big sister is being molested by [povname].
She always tell her boyfriend that she hates [povname].
Furthermore, Emily starts to feel grief.
She thinks that was a mistake to accept that kind of relationship.
Will [povname] be able to build his Harem (including stealing girls from other guys), or will he end up losing everything?
It all depends on your choices.
In case you missed any of these erotic scenes:
Suzie in her NTR virgin ending.

Suzie with Woody.
Emily with Alex.

Suzie with Jim.

You can come to my page {a=https://www.patreon.com/captainkitty}Captain Kitty{/a} to download the walkthrough to know how to reach those scenes.
You can also support me there to continue developing Jealousy, the sequel of The Engagement.
My games are free for everyone but my supporters have the privilege to play it before the public.
To start The Engagement, I borrowed money from my friend to buy a laptop with a 1050Ti GPU.
This is one of the first images I made by that laptop.
Later, with everyone's support, I paid him back all of the money.
And I also had enough money to build the current PC with a 1080 GPU.
The image quality is much better now.
But when I was working on the final version of The Engagement, I realized that I would have to upgrade with a better GPU to have erotic scenes with 4 or more people.
The current GPU can only work with 3 people to have fine quality.
It will be very slow (especially in scenes with more complex assets like bed, pillows, walls...) to render more than 3 people without reducing the textures (which will also decrease the image quality).
You can see in this image.
At first the camera faced towards them.
But because it was very heavy with the background, it would cost me 12 hours to render.
So I had to change to render from above, which I only needed 3 hours.
Your support helps me improve my PC to develop faster and better.
Again, I want to say thank you for your support.
Without you, I couldn't finish The Engagement and couldn't start Jealousy in December.
See you again, in Jealousy.
Are you 18 or above?
Yes, I am.
No, I'm not.
